WORKING

- Add feature to exchange page to sell percentage instead of indvidual.

exchange.php
   /* 
   //For when I give the option for individual or percentage of company 
    //check to see if quantity or percentage is selected
        @$quantityType = $_POST["quantityType"]; //percent or individual
    //if percentage, grab post value
        if($quantityType=="percentage")
        {   $percentage = $_POST["percentage"];
    //see how many owned
            $stocksPercentageOwned = query("SELECT quantity FROM portfolio WHERE (id = ? AND symbol=? ORDER BY symbol ASC", $id, $symbol);	  // query user's portfolio
    //calculate the percentage for trade
            $quantity = $stocksPercentageOwned*$percentage;
        }
        else{$quantity=$_POST["quantity"]:}
    */



exchange_form.php
<script>
        //percentageAmount.value=percentage.value;
<!-- 
PERCENTAGE FOR ASK ORDER: 100% = WHAT THEY OWN
PERCENTAGE FOR BID ORDER: 100% = PERCENTAGE OF COMPANY < WON'T WORK!
Eventually add the ability select either quantity or a percentage of owned; ie. owns 4,000 shares so 75% would be 3,000 shares)
