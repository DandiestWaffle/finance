1780s - The American market had already accepted the Spanish dollar as its basic unit of value. It was minted in Mexico and called a “piece of eight,” or a peso. The words Spanish peso are said to have been abbreviated into an S and a P with one written over the other. This was further abbreviated to a “$” sign. The word dollar originally came from a Bohemian word thal, meaning “valley.” A silver coin was minted in a certain Bohemian valley and became known as a “thaler,” which was transliterated into English as a “dollar.” In the 1700s, the Spanish came out with a silver coin of almost exactly the same size and weight as a thaler. It represented eight Spanish gold “reals” and was therefore called a “piece of eight.” In the marketplace merchants referred to this as the “Spanish dollar.” However, to make change, they would cut a dollar into eight pieces or “bits.” These began to be called two bits for a quarter, four bits for fifty cents, and six bits for seventy-five cents.
<hr>
<a name="1785"></a>
In 1785, two years before the Constitution was written, the Congress accepted the Spanish dollar as the official unit of value for the United States and determined that all foreign coin would be evaluated in terms of the Spanish dollar.
<br><br><br>
<a name="1786"></a>
In 1786, the year before the Constitution was adopted, the Board of Treasury fixed the silver weight of the adopted dollar at 375 and 64/100s grains of fine silver. The value of gold coins or any other coins was to be calculated in terms of the silver dollar of this weight and fineness.
<hr>
        <p>It will be noted that three things had been established before the Constitution was adopted:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>That the official money of the United States would be precious metals&#8211;silver and gold.</li>
        <li>That the basic unit of value would be called a &#8220;dollar&#8221; and consist of 375 and 64/100s grains of fine silver.</li>
        <li>All other coins, both foreign and domestic, would be evaluated in terms of this official silver dollar.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All of this was already part of the law of the land when the Constitution was adopted. Therefore, the Founders wrote the following provisions in the Constitution concerning money based on the above statutes which had previously been adopted as the official monetary system.</p>
        <p>They wrote:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Congress shall have the power &#8220;to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.&#8221; (Article I, section 8, clause 5.)</li>
        <li>Congress shall have the power to punish the counterfeiting of money. (Article I, section 8, clause 6.)</li>
        <li>No tax on imported persons (bonded servants) shall exceed ten dollars. Note the reference to &#8220;dollars&#8221; in this provision.(Article I, section 9, clause 1.)</li>
        <li>No state shall coin money, emit bills of credit, or make anything but gold and silver tender in payment of debts. (Article 1, section 10, clause 1.)</li>
        <li>In civil cases for more than twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. (Seventh Amendment.)</li>
        </ol>

The Coinage Act of 1792 established the United States Mint and regulated the coinage of the United States. This act established the silver dollar as the unit of money in the United States, declared it to be lawful tender, and created a decimal system for U.S. currency. The silver coinage of 1794 and 1795 employed a 0.900 fine standard instead of the 0.8924+ standard (371.25/416) as prescribed in the Mint Act of 1792. The most immediate effect of this practice was that depositors ended up paying an additional 2.5 grams of silver bullion (about 10% extra) for every dollar they received. The Act defined the proportional value of gold and silver as 15:1. GOLD 24.75 grains $1/ SILVER 371.25 grains $1.
<hr>
<a name="1834"></a>
The Coinage Act of 1834 was passed by the United States Congress on June 27, 1834. It raised the silver-to-gold weight ratio from its 1792 level of 15:1 (established by the Coinage Act of 1792) to 16:1 thus setting the mint price for silver at a level below its international market price. After the Coinage Act of 1834, silver (which was previously overvalued with respect to gold) became significantly undervalued and was exported to European markets where it was traded at a higher price. After its passage, one ounce of gold was the equivalent of $20.67. The silver content of the silver dollar was left unchanged at 371.25 grains and the fine content of gold coins was reduced from 24.75 grains to 23.2 grains. GOLD 23.2 grains $1/ SILVER 371.25 grains $1.

Gold Rush - 1848-1855. When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush, silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. 
<hr>
<a name="1849"></a>
The Coinage Act of 1849, or the Gold Coinage Act, was an act of the United States Congress which allowed for the minting of two new denominations of gold coins, the gold dollar and the gold $20 or double eagle. This was enacted largely due to the California Gold Rush.
<hr>
<a name="1853"></a>
The Coinage Act of 1853 nudged the United States closer to single monetary standard based upon gold. It provided for the coinage of subsidiary silver coins to support small transactions without endangering the precedence of gold as the preeminent monetary metal. The conditions that spurred Congress to approve the Coinage Act of 1853 grew directly out of the Coinage Act of 1834. That act had decreased the gold metal content of gold coins relative to face value, drawing gold to the mint for coinage at the expense of silver. At United States mint prices, 16 ounces of silver matched in value an ounce of gold, more ounces of silver than was needed to purchase an ounce of gold on the free market. The flow of silver to the mint fell to a trickle, and speculators melted down silver coins and sold them for bullion. The proponents of the Act of 1834 had foreseen that the act would lift gold to preeminence as the primary monetary standard, and that overvalued gold coins would drive undervalued silver coins out of circulation. They did not anticipate that the disappearance of the small denomination silver coinage would impose a hardship on retail businesses. Under the pre–Civil War coinage system, the mint struck the gold eagle, gold half eagle, and gold quarter eagle in face values of $10, $5, and $2.50, respectively. In silver coinage the mint struck the silver dollar, the half dollar, the quarter, the dime, and half dime. Ten dimes had the same silver content as a silver dollar. As speculators sold silver coinage for bullion, merchants and consumers stood without the coinage to settle minor transactions. The Coinage Act of 1853 reduced the silver content of the half dollar, the quarter, and the dime and half dime, but left the silver content of the silver dollar untouched. The silver content of a silver dollar remained at 371.5 grains of pure silver, but a dollar’s worth of half dollars, quarters, dimes, and half dimes dropped to only 345.6 grains of pure silver, about a 7 percent reduction. The Treasury continued to stand ready to accept unlimited amounts of silver for coinage into silver dollars, but the act authorized the Treasury’s purchase of only limited amounts of silver to mint subsidiary coinage, that is, half dollars, quarters, dimes, and half dimes. The act gave the Treasury the authority to decide the amount of silver to purchase for subsidiary coinage, an amount that would necessarily be less than holders of silver would want to bring to the Treasury at overvalued prices. The purpose of the act was to maintain gold as the primary monetary metal while furnishing the public with a subsidiary silver coinage. Theoretically, the United States remained on a bimetallic standard because silver dollars enjoyed a legal-tender status, but in practice no silver dollars were coined. The act provided that subsidiary coinage was legal tender for amounts up to $5.00, raising issues that would surface later when the government made paper money legal tender. A flavor of how antagonistic feelings ran on this issue is echoed in the remarks of the bill’s major opponent, Andrew Johnson, later vice president, and then president upon the death of Lincoln. I look upon this bill as the merest quackery—the veriest charlatanism—so far as the currency of the country is concerned. The idea of Congress fixing the value of currency is an absurdity, notwithstanding the language of the Constitution—not the meaning of it. If we can by law make $107 out of $100, we can by the same process make it worth $150. Why, Sir, of all the problems that have come up for solution, from the time of the alchemists down to the present time, none can compare with that solved by this modern Congress. They alone have discovered that they can make money—that they can make $107 out of $100. If they can increase it to that extent, they can go on and increase it to infinity, and thus, by the operation of the mint, the government can supply its own revenues (Watson, 1970). The Coinage Act of 1853 achieved its purpose. Small coinage increased in circulation, and after 1857 foreign coins were no longer legal tender in the United States. After the outbreak of the Civil War, all metallic coinage went into hiding, and the United States turned to an inconvertible paper standard. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the battle between gold and silver was fought anew before the United States settled firmly on a gold standard, without even the pretence of a bimetallic standard based upon gold and silver. When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush, silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative (and future president) Andrew Johnson, the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853, allowing them to circulate. Until then, depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above; the 1853 act lightened the silver coins from the half dime to the half dollar and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations. Depositors could still choose to have silver struck into dollars, but the high price of silver made it more profitable to use the bullion in other ways. So long as silver prices remained high, this effectively placed the United States on the gold standard
<hr>

The Coinage Act of 1857 was an act of the United States Congress which forbade the use of foreign coins as legal tender, repealing all acts "authorizing the currency of foreign gold or silver coins". Before the Act, foreign coins, such as the Spanish dollar, were widely used. This was the first major step towards the government essentially having a monopoly over the money supply.

1859-1874: Comstock Lode Silver Rush.  Comstock Lode and other Western mining areas were producing record amounts of silver. With a depression still ongoing, silver began to be seen as a means of inflating the currency and stimulating the economy.

The Coinage Act of 1873 abolished the right of depositors of silver bullion to have their metal struck into legal tender dollar coins, it ended bimetallism in the United States, placing the nation firmly on the gold standard. Because of this, the act became contentious in later years, and was denounced by people who wanted inflation as the "Crime of '73". The matter became a major political controversy that lasted the remainder of the century, pitting those who valued the deflationary gold standard against those who believed free coinage of silver to be necessary for economic prosperity. Accusations were made that the passage of the act had been secured through corruption, though there is little evidence of this. The gold standard was explicitly enacted into law in 1900.
<hr>
<a name="1900"></a>
The Gold Standard Act of 1900 established gold as the only standard for redeeming paper money, stopping bimetallism (which had allowed silver in exchange for gold). It was signed by President William McKinley. The Act made the de facto gold standard in place since the Coinage Act of 1873 (whereby debt holders could demand reimbursement in whatever metal was preferred--usually gold) a de jure gold standard alongside other major European powers at the time. The Act fixed the value of the dollar at 25 8⁄10 grains of gold at "nine-tenths fine" (90% purity), equivalent to 23.22 grains (1.5046 grams) of pure gold. The Gold Standard Act confirmed the United States' commitment to the gold standard by assigning gold a specific dollar value (just over $20.67 per Troy ounce). This took place after McKinley sent a team to Europe to try to make a silver agreement with France and Great Britain. On April 25, 1933, the United States and Canada dropped the gold standard.

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is an Act of Congress that created and established the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States of America, and granted it the legal authority to issue Federal Reserve Notes (now commonly known as the U.S. Dollar) and Federal Reserve Bank Notes as legal tender. The Act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson.
<hr>
<a name="1933"></a>
From 1914 to 1933, every Federal Reserve note was redeemable in gold and silver.
<hr>
Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt "forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States". The effect of the order, in conjunction with the statute under which it was issued, was to criminalize the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation. GOLD from 1/20.67 to 1/35.
<hr>
<a name="1934"></a>
Between 1933 and 1963, all Federal Reserve notes promised to pay (or be redeemed) in “lawful money,” which meant silver. Then the wording on the Federal Reserve notes began to be changed to somewhat obscure language, which should have given Americans a warning that the government was planning something.
<hr>
On January 30, 1934, the Gold Reserve Act was passed, giving the Federal Reserve title to all the gold which had been collected. This act also changed the price of gold from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce, which meant that all of the silver certificates the people had recently received for their gold now lost 40 percent of their value. The next day the President proclaimed (48 Stat. 1730) that the dollar was to be fixed at 15 and 5/21 grains of standard gold and was to be maintained at this level “in perpetuity.” This is still the definition of the “dollar” in the United States code. Russia and the central banks of Europe began buying up gold in huge quantities. Thus there came into being a dual monetary system: a gold standard for foreigners and Federal Reserve notes (redeemable in silver) for Americans.
<hr>
<a name="1965"></a>
In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson authorized the treasury to begin issuing debased “sandwich” dimes and quarters with little or no intrinsic value, and the quantity of silver in fifty-cent pieces was reduced to 40 percent.
<hr>
<a name="1968"></a>
On June 24, 1968, President Johnson issued a proclamation that henceforth Federal Reserve silver certificates were merely fiat legal tender and could not be redeemed in silver.
<hr>
<a name="1970"></a>
On December 31, 1970, President Richard Nixon authorized the treasury to issue debased “sandwich” dollars and half dollars.
<hr>
<a name="1971"></a>
The 1971 Nixon Shock was a series of economic measures undertaken by United States President Richard Nixon in 1971, the most significant of which was the unilateral cancellation of the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold.
<hr>
By August 1971, many of the European countries had collected so many billions in Eurodollars (foreign aid, money spent by the U.S. military abroad, etc.) that European banks had begun to get nervous about redeeming their money in gold. A threatened run on the U.S. Treasury resulted in the American gold window being slammed shut. This resulted in collapse of the dollar on the world market. Since then it has fluctuated on the world market like any other commodity, since it is no longer redeemable in precious metal and therefore has no intrinsic value.
<hr>
<a name="1973"></a>
In 1973, the U.S. dollar was officially devalued, changing the price of gold from $35 per ounce to $42.23 per ounce.
<hr>
On March 16, 1973, Congress set the American dollar completely afloat with nothing to back it up but the declaration of the government that it was “legal tender,” or fiat currency.
<hr>
The world market immediately reflected serious erosion in the value of the American dollar. To buy an ounce of the gold it took not $42.23 but $100, then $200. After that, it moved higher and higher until it required $800 to buy an ounce of gold. Gradually some confidence was restored in the dollar as the symbol of the American economy, and so it settled back down to a plateau of approximately $300 plus.

                recent bull market in gold and silver has generated much discussion
                in the media regarding the &quot;gold standard&quot; of the past - versus the
                present system of irredeemable paper fiat currency known as Federal
                Reserve Notes.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Even
                the issue of the constitutionality of the Federal Reserve and the
                irredeemable fractional reserve banking system it wields, as the
                Sword of Damocles above unwary heads, has been debated. Many well-intentioned
                and knowledgeable writers have rightfully questioned both the efficacy
                and the soundness of the present monetary system of paper fiat.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Numerous
                articles often discuss the &quot;gold standard&quot; of past history, including
                the recommendation of a return to the standard of old, as being both
                the financial and constitutional &quot;fix&quot; for our present financial
                problems.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">However,
                is the &quot;gold standard&quot; as popularly put forth and understood by
                most of these well-intentioned articles, the same as the original
                constitutional standard and &quot;hard&quot; money system, as stated within
                the Constitution of the United States?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">And
                perhaps of even greater importance, is whether returning to the &quot;gold
                standard&quot; of old - at least the &quot;version&quot; that is most often referenced
                and discussed, in contra-distinction to the original constitutional
                standard - is truly the fix-all for the debilitated and debased
                state of our present monetary system of irredeemable paper currency.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Most,
                but not all, of those friendly to the precious metals or hard money
                persuasion, sometimes referred to as gold-bugs, speak of the &quot;gold
                standard&quot; of the past as if it were sacrosanct and beyond reproach - and
                thus the standard deemed most suitable as the model for modern
                day monetary reform. But perhaps this model is flawed, which inherently,
                yet almost unknowingly, except to the elite few who perpetrated
                the crime, contributed to its intended demise.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">The
                belief seems widely accepted, that the &quot;gold standard&quot; of the later
                1800's and the early 1900's, is sufficient historical documentation
                of our monetary system to explain not only the problems with the
                present fiat currency; but to also provide the remedy for any such
                ills to simply be a return to the &quot;gold standard&quot; of the past.</span></font></p>

                views may very well explain and offer the best course of monetary
                reform, but then again, perhaps they do not: perhaps there are
                other more sound and honest alternatives; that are closer in keeping
                with our original Constitution - as opposed to the present system
                of irredeemable promises to pay.</span></font></p>

                or Treasury Notes or Federal Reserve Notes are redeemable in gold
                coin. Occasionally, those of a &quot;purer&quot; ideal, refer to the establishing
                of the one dollar gold coin - which was set by statute as the standard
                unit of our monetary system - hence the term &quot;gold standard&quot;.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">However,
                this setting of the one dollar gold coin as our standard unit of
                account, did not take place until 1873; and more importantly, is
                whether the Act was and is, in accordance with the Constitution
                and the Original Coinage Act of 1792?</span></font></p>

                use the creation of the &quot;gold standard&quot; as a starting point for
                monetary reform, involves taking quite the leap of faith - as there
                may be much more to understanding our currency system than just
                the &quot;gold standard&quot; that involved various paper issuances, that
                were supposedly backed by, and could be, redeemed for gold coin.
                Even the minting of gold coins such as the gold eagles; or the
                coinage of a gold &quot;dollar&quot;; or the coining of the magnificent gold
                double eagles, leaves out a great amount of very important monetary

                by the Constitution - regardless if they (bills of credit) are
                redeemable or not in gold or silver coin; and more importantly - whether
                the Constitution directly forbids the issuance of such paper money.</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Many
                of these well-intentioned articles on gold and or the &quot;gold standard&quot; often
                use the word &quot;dollar&quot; in describing &quot;money&quot;, almost in a flippant
                manner - as if the definition of a &quot;dollar&quot; is automatically understood,
                both by the general reading audience, and by most writers on the

                often it is taken for granted, that the definition of the &quot;dollar&quot; has
                always been one and the same - which it has been constitutionally,
                and according to the Original Coinage Act of 1792. Various subsequent
                coinage acts, however, and the generally false beliefs of both
                government officials and the public at large, that such legislation
                was intended to, and did perpetuate; have seemingly changed the
                definition of the &quot;dollar&quot; from the original intent of the Constitution.</span></font></p>

                of which has led to the present make believe world of the Federal
                Reserve, and the infamous Federal Reserve Note or dollar bill;
                and whether it just may be possible that a dollar bill, and a&nbsp; &quot;dollar&quot;,
                are two distinct and separate entities - as different from one
                another as night and day.</span></font></p>

                lieu of the above, we are naturally led to ask whether or not the
                above assumptions of most present day writers on the &quot;gold standard&quot; and
                the &quot;dollar&quot; are correct, according to the actual history that
                has transpired?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Also,
                is it possible that some of the history regarding these subjects
                has been left out and hidden from the public eye - by deceitful
                design and behind the scenes manipulation, undertaken by the self-same
                powers and interests that brought forth the Federal Reserve, and
                its irredeemable paper fiat currency: to purposefully confuse the
                issues and muddy the waters?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">As
                unbelievable and stunning as it may prove to be, perhaps the powers
                that have brought us the Federal Reserve, also brought us the &quot;gold
                standard&quot;; and the First and Second Banks of the United States,
                pre-cursors of our central bank; and perhaps for the same reasons:
                as a means of implementing a wealth transference system of plunder - from &quot;We
                The People&quot; to &quot;they&quot; who control the system - by dishonest attempts
                to discredit both gold and silver, by entangling and implementing
                them in unworkable standards and systems, that were knowingly doomed
                to fail from the start.</span></font></p>

                views have been put forth that under the &quot;gold standard&quot; money
                is gold - perhaps this is true - but perhaps there is a bit more
                to it. Is the meaning of the statement that money is gold, the
                same as - gold is money? This involves much more then mere semantics,
                as will be seen.</span></font></p>

                  none has been more effective than that which deludes them with
                  paper money.&quot; This is very much true, but does it not include all
                  paper money, even if fractionally backed by gold, as under a &quot;gold
                  standard&quot;?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Is
                the &quot;gold standard&quot; where paper currency is backed by gold, the

                a system of state or even national private banks that issue paper
                currency, the same as a system where the government becomes partners
                with a national central bank, that Congress grants the sole monopoly
                of power to issue bank notes to - that are only fractionally backed
                by gold?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">And
                lastly, is the present system of paper fiat currency, that is not
                only irredeemable and no longer backed by gold; but is also the
                mechanism and means, by which all Treasury bond or government debt
                is monetized - exactly the same as any of the systems that came
                before it, and led to its creation; or is it a gross genetic mutation,
                engendered by the interbreeding of the preceding diseased and sickly
                schemes of issue?</span></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">So
                let's take a trip back in time and follow the money and see where
                it leads us - perhaps we will be able to discover a story not often
                told about our monetary heritage; and from whence this thing called &quot;money&quot; and &quot;dollar&quot; has
                come; all in the pursuit of: Honest Money.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
                will start by examining &quot;money&quot; according to the Constitution and
                the Original Coinage Act of 1792. Next we will look at the subsequent
                Coinage Acts that defined our monetary system. Then the different
                Treasury Note Issuances will be looked at to see how they fit in.
                And finally we will go back to the pre-Constitutional history of
                Colonial America to see from whence this &quot;business&quot; of central banking
                was born. A summary of conclusions will then be provided.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#006699"><b>DISCUSSION OF EARLY MONETARY HISTORY</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Of
                particular interest and importance in reading over these provisions
                is to note that the word &quot;money&quot; appears but four times in the original
                constitutional document. The word &quot;coin&quot; appears five times; the
                word &quot;dollar&quot; appears but twice; the word &quot;credit&quot; twice; and the
                word &quot;tender&quot; appears but once. Conspicuously absent is the word - paper,
                although &quot;bills of credit&quot; is a close surrogate.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Most
                striking is the fact that nowhere in the Constitution is a literal
                definition of the &quot;dollar&quot; provided. Was the lack of such an important
                definition as to the dollar or unit of account of our monetary system
                an oversight by such an august and learned group of men as the First
                Congress?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Or
                did our Founding Fathers perhaps know uncontrovertibly the definition
                of the dollar that at the current time was universally accepted by
                all? -&nbsp; As in like manner, the usage of the word &quot;day&quot; or &quot;time&quot; within
                the Constitution was understood, and the definition was not seen
                to be needed, required, or given - as it was already known.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Perhaps
                by examining the past monetary history from which the Constitution
                evolved, as well as the monetary history the Constitution gave birth
                to, a clearer understanding of the Constitution's meaning and intent
                can be revealed.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
                Blackstone noted in his &quot;Commentaries&quot;: &quot;Sir Edward Coke lays it
                down, that the money of England must be either gold or silver; and
                none other was ever issued by the royal authority till 1672, when
                copper farthings and half-pence were coined&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">During
                our early Colonial history, Queen Anne's Proclamation of 1704, and
                the Parliamentary Act of 1707 both referred to &quot;...regulation of coin
                according to their weight and fineness in proportion to the rate
                before limited and set for the Pieces of Eight of Sevil, Pillar,
                and Mexico... commonly known as the silver Spanish milled dollars&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
                1776 a report in the Journals of the Continental Congress referred
                to &quot;the precise weight and fineness of the Spanish milled dollar
                now becoming the Money-Unit or common measure of other coins in these

                Continental Congress subsequently laid the groundwork for The Constitution

                discussion:</font></p>

                  into any treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate the
                  value thereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for
                  the defense and welfare of the United States, or any of them, nor
                  emit bills, nor borrow money on the credit of the United States,
                  nor appropriate money, nor agree upon the number of vessels of
                  war, to be built or purchased, or the number of land or sea forces
                  to be raised, nor appoint a commander in chief of the army or navy,
                  unless nine States assent to the same: nor shall a question on
                  any other point, except for adjourning from day to day be determined,
                  unless by the votes of the majority of the United States in Congress

                express the monetary powers granted to Congress and that are of importance
                to this discussion have been previously listed above.</font></p>

                said.</font></p>

                      ACT OF 1792</b></font></font></p>
              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><u>Article
                I, Section 8, clause 5</u> of The Constitution states that Congress
                has the &quot;power to coin money&quot; and furthermore <u>Article I, Section
                  10, Clause 1</u> specifies that &quot; No State shall...coin Money; emit
                Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender
                in Payment of Debt.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                Constitution undeniably grants Congress the power to coin money,
                i.e. to form and shape metal (silver, gold &amp; copper) and to regulate
                its weight and purity and to affix the stamp of the issuing government
                thereon.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">From
                ages past, before the time of the Bible, man has coined metal to
                be used as money. Accordingly, money is brought forth into society
                to be used as a medium of exchange to facilitate the trade of goods
                of all kinds. The use of money involves the progress from direct
                exchange or bartering of goods, to the indirect exchange of goods
                using a common medium: money.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                free acts of individual commerce, that collectively form an economic
                body of trade, chooses and decides by its own internal market forces
                of supply and demand, what commodity is most widely accepted as &quot;the
                medium of exchange&quot; - money.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
                have seen that in early Colonial times that the Spanish milled Silver
                Dollar had been the most popular and widely accepted coin then current,
                although many other different types of coin also circulated.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                Constitution clearly states that money is to be coined and that only
                gold and silver coin (i.e. money) is a tender in payment of debt.
                Note that Congress was never granted the power to print money, only
                to coin it.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
                the Constitution does not define exactly what a &quot;dollar&quot; is, although
                twice it refers to the dollar - once in <u>Article I, Section 9,
                  Clause 1</u> and once in <u>Amendment VII</u>.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Let
                us now once again turn our attention to the Coinage Act of 1792 to
                see if the Founding Fathers and Congress expressly and explicitly
                defined the &quot;dollar&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><u>In
                Section 20 of the Coinage Act</u> we read, &quot;...that the money of
                account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars or units.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
                are now getting closer to our goal for a definition of a dollar.
                Congress in <u>Section 20</u> clearly states that the money of account
                of the U.S. is expressed in dollars, which are &quot;units&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><u>In
                Section 9 of the Coinage Act</u> we read that &quot;...That there shall
                be from time to time struck and coined at the said mint, coins
                of gold, silver, and copper, of the following denomination, values
                and descriptions, viz. Eagles - each to be of the value of ten dollars
                or units and to contain two hundred and forty-seven grains and
                four eighths of a grain of pure, or two hundred and seventy grains
                of standard gold.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Here
                we clearly see that Congress coined Eagles that were of the value
                of ten dollars or units. But an Eagle was not a &quot;dollar&quot;, but of
                the value of ten dollars. So what is the definition of a dollar?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Further
                on in <u>Section 9</u> it is stated, &quot;...dollars or Units - each to be
                of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current,
                and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenths
                parts of a grain of pure silver, or four hundred and sixteen grains
                of standard silver.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">At
                long last - the goal we have been searching for - the definition
                of &quot;the dollar&quot; or unit - each to be of the value of a Spanish milled
                dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and
                seventy-one grains and four sixteenths parts of a grain of pure silver,
                or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">According
                to the documents we have so far examined, we find that the Constitution
                grants Congress the power to coin money while explicitly limiting
                the states to make &quot;any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in
                Payment of Debt&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
                further find in the Coinage Act of 1792, that the money of account
                of the United States shall be denominated in dollars or units of
                the value of a Spanish Silver Dollar, as was current at the time
                (1792). Also note that the Gold Eagle is to have a value of ten dollars
                or units.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
                means that originally our monetary system had as its standard the
                Spanish Silver Dollar, and that the Gold Eagle coin was not a &quot;dollar&quot;,
                but was measured against the silver standard, being valued at ten
                dollars or units or 3,712 - 1Ãš2 grains of fine silver.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congress
                had statutorily defined and legislatively implemented a bimetallic
                system of coinage - that had the Silver Dollar as the standard where:</font></p>

                  proportional value of gold and silver in all coins shall be fifteen
                  to one, according to quantity in weight, of pure gold or pure silver
                  and that all the gold and silver coins which shall have been struck
                  at, and issued from the said mint, shall be a lawful tender in all
                  payments whatsoever, those of full weight according to the respective
                  values herein before declared, and those of less than full weight
                  at values proportional to their respective weights&quot;.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                widely accepted belief that originally the United States was on a

                had originally ever issued a gold &quot;dollar&quot; or that the Constitution
                ever granted Congress such power is also incorrect.</font></p>

                first monetary standard was a silver standard that defined the &quot;dollar&quot; as
                a specific weight of silver, as well as establishing that the &quot;dollar&quot; was
                the &quot;money or unit of account&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
                a bimetallic monetary system of coinage was also established by the
                Constitutional mandate to Congress to &quot;coin Money, regulate the Value
                thereof&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                word &quot;regulate&quot; means to &quot;adjust&quot;, as in one thing to another - which
                in the use of coins refers to systems of weights and measures and
                the regulation of such weights and measures to the standard, which
                is the &quot;measure&quot; they are to be regulated to or against.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
                stated in the Coinage Act of 1792 - <u>Section 11</u> introduces
                an exchange ratio of 15 to 1, according to weight.&nbsp; Therefore,
                although a dollar was defined as 371.25 grains of silver, gold exchanged
                for a dollar at 24.75 grains of gold (10 x 371.25 divided by 15).&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Also, <u>Section
                9</u> of the act defined the Eagle as containing two hundred and
                forty-seven grains and four eighths of a grain of pure, or two
                hundred and seventy grains of standard gold.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">To
                reiterate: the standard was Silver - the monetary system of exchange
                was a bimetallic system of coinage.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Note,
                however, that the &quot;dollar&quot; that the Coinage Act of 1792 statutorily
                decreed was not the exact original &quot;Constitutional dollar&quot; - but
                as the act says, &quot;...each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Thus &quot;each&quot; denotes
                something that is not the Spanish milled dollar but is to be the &quot;value&quot; (specific
                weight and fineness) of the Spanish milled dollar.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Furthermore,
                originally there was no gold dollar - only a gold Eagle valued at
                ten dollars. The Coinage Act of 1849 created the first gold dollar
                57 years later. Any reference to an &quot;original gold dollar&quot; dating
                back to the Constitution is incorrect.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
                have thus answered the question regarding whether or not the United
                States was originally on a &quot;gold standard&quot; according to the monetary
                powers granted in the Constitution and according to the subsequent
                legislative statues of the original Coinage Act of 1792.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                answer emphatically being - No - the standard was the then current
                Silver Spanish Dollar known as Pieces of Eight, coupled with a bimetallic
                system of coinage using both silver and gold.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
                is not a matter of semantics - there are very important distinctions
                of detail involved that have greatly affected our monetary history - especially
                our present system of irredeemable paper fiat currency - incestuously
                wedded to its sibling: fractional reserve banking, spawned in greed - nurtured
                by the lust for power.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
                we have seen, the Constitution along with the Coinage Act of 1792,
                established by statutory decree that the dollar was the unit of account
                and also declared that a dollar or unit was &quot;each to be of the value
                of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain
                three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of
                a grain of pure silver, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard
                silver&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">According
                to statute, the United States was on the silver standard. However,
                as we have seen, Congress also decreed that gold coins were to be
                minted and circulated along side of silver coins, and fixed the statutory
                valuation of silver to gold at 15 to 1.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
                other words, Congress had &quot;fixed&quot; the exchange rate between the two
                metals. Thus the United States was on a silver standard, but it was
                also on a bimetallic system of coinage, that included gold to be
                circulated at a &quot;fixed&quot; exchange rate to the silver standard.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Such
                a system can present problems, however, as the free market exchange
                rate between gold and silver can diverge from the statutory or legally
                fixed exchange rate - necessitating the adjustment of the other metals
                legal value up or down to conform to the statutory fixed rate of
                exchange.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
                other words, Congress was trying to make two different types of metal
                coinage equal in purchasing power. This was not a good idea and would
                have been better left undone.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
                also raises the very interesting question as to whether or not this &quot;fixing&quot; was
                an accidental mistake, by very learned men, well acquainted with
                this exact monetary issue, as the discussions of such are in the
                Congressional records.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Past
                historical monetary writings also address the issue in detail. Perhaps
                such was not a mistake, but was very much intended and planned, although
                unknown by most but a select few. We will trust the reader with making
                such determinations, as the following discussions occasion.</font></p>

                LEGAL TENDER &amp; PURCHASING POWER</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Involved
                in the issue of &quot;fixed&quot; exchange, are the ideas of legal tender and
                the concept of purchasing power.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Legal
                tender has to do with distinguishing between the legal or juristic
                meaning of money, and the purely economic meaning and use of money.
                The term legal tender refers to the medium of payment that is designated
                as the legally accepted settlement of debts, especially debts due
                and owed to the government.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Money
                in the purely economic sense is commonly referred to as the medium
                of exchange or that which the common man uses to exchange one good
                for another to facilitate commerce and trade.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
                a free market environment, whatever is determined to be the legal
                medium of payment (legal tender) must first naturally evolve as the
                accepted medium of exchange. Man by free choice determines what is
                to be money - the most commonly accepted or marketable medium of
                exchange.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">A
                truly free society or government will only declare as legal tender,
                that media that society has already chosen as the accepted medium
                of exchange by its own free will.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
                we have seen with the development of our Constitution and its monetary
                policy, the dollar was the unit or medium of exchange that was the
                most accepted then current medium - a specific weight and fineness
                of silver - the &quot;silver dollar&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Any
                alteration in this Constitutional dollar, both as the medium of exchange
                and the medium of payment or legal tender - without a Constitutional
                amendment - would not be the workings of a free society or government,
                but one of forced obedience.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
                also goes to the point that the legal intrinsic value of the dollar
                is the physical amount of silver or gold as measured against the &quot;standard&quot;,
                which in the case of the U.S. dollar is a specific weight of silver.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
                the economic value or purchasing power of the medium of exchange
                is not &quot;intrinsic&quot;, as it is not based on an objective determination
                or standard, but on the subjective valuations of the market participants.
                Some refer to this as the subjective theory of value or the theory
                of declining marginal utility.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">It
                is exactly this difference - between the legal intrinsic value of
                money based on an objective standard or defined weight of metal - versus
                the subjective value of the medium of exchange that changes according
                to the supply and demand of the marketplace - that precludes any
                system of bimetallic coinage, that sets one metal as the standard,
                and then declares the other metal to be &quot;exchangeable&quot; for the standard
                metal at a &quot;fixed&quot; rate of exchange - to be inherently doomed to
                fighting free market forces and laws of supply and demand, continually
                requiring &quot;regulatory&quot; legislation&nbsp; and &quot;adjustment&quot;. Such is
                not the workings, of a truly free market, but of a contrived or fixed
                market.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Although
                in the strict technical and statutory sense, the standard was silver
                and the system of coinage was bimetallic - in all practical applications
                or according to the prevailing &quot;populist&quot; views - the system was
                a duometallic system that reciprocally recognized and exchanged one
                metal for the other.&nbsp; As will be shown, however, the system
                fluctuated back and forth from one metal to the other, and with good
                cause - the purposefully contrived reasons of power and influence:
                all in the pursuit of profit and gain.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Establishing
                fixed exchange rates allows &quot;Gresham's Law&quot; to enter the
                picture, whereby an artificially overvalued money tends to drive
                an artificially undervalued money out of circulation.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Free
                markets and supply and demand being what they are, inevitably the
                market values one metal over the other. Eventually one metal is driven
                out by the other. This process is oft times referred to as &quot;demonetization&quot;.&nbsp; But
                remember, bimetallism under a fixed standard is not necessarily a
                completely free system.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Starting
                slowly in the 1780's, the market value of silver slid downwards,
                steadily continuing down through the 1790's, up until about 1804-1805;
                mainly in response to the increased supply of silver from Mexico
                and the diminishing supplies of gold from Russia; while at the same
                time, its mint price remained the same, thereby causing silver to
                be overvalued in relation to gold.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Gold
                coins started to flow out of our country and ceased to circulate,
                while silver coin flowed in and was abundant. Gold coin was melted
                down and exported abroad. From 1800 to 1834 only silver coin circulated
                as the currency of choice. Gold had been driven out - but by what
                force? Might there be an unseen &quot;guiding hand&quot;?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">First
                gold was driven out of circulation, and then over time silver became
                the lackey, until eventually both metals were driven into exile and
                buried beneath a mountain of worthless paper debt and hollow promises
                to pay: that is our now current system of paper fiat - a mere shade
                of its former self. But such events beg the question: a lackey of
                whom or by what power?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congress
                would have been better off to have simply minted gold Eagles without
                fixing a dollar value on them, thereby allowing the free market forces
                of supply and demand to regulate their exchange rate value. This
                would help prevent the &quot;authorized&quot; control by other than free market
                principles or by &quot;others&quot;.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Because
                of this flaw in a bimetallic system of coinage that has one metal

                metals, and the resulting &quot;crying&quot; up or down of the value of one
                metal in regards to the other - our monetary history was one where

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            various monetary acts from 1792 until the act of 1834 were not of
            any important consequence and did not stray far from the original
            constitutional plan. Most of the acts had to do with “regulating” the
            value of foreign coinage with our own coin. The first act of major
            importance was the Act of 1834.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#006699"><br>
  COINAGE ACT OF 1834</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
            stated within the Constitution, Congress has been granted the power
            to “coin money” and to “regulate the value thereof”. The Original
            Coinage Act of 1792 established the ratio of silver to gold at 15
            to 1.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Coinage Act of 1834, in keeping with the Congressional authority
            to regulate the “value” of coinage, set new “values” for domestic
            coins – redefining the eagle as 232 grains of pure gold.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Due
            to the workings of Gresham’s Law, one metal had become dearer and
            the other farther, as gold coin had almost ceased circulating for
            several years. The reason being that although the exchange value
            of the metals had been fixed in regards to coinage, the market value
            of the metals as commodities continued to change.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            commodity price of gold appreciated relative to its exchange value
            as currency, this caused gold to stop circulating as coin and to
            be melted down and or exported for profit. Congress thus raised or
            regulated the exchange ratio to attempt to stop this problem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Act of 1792 had set the weight at 247-1/2 grains of pure gold, or
            at 15 to l ratio with silver. The Act of 1834 set the weight at 232
            grains, or at a 16 to 1 ratio.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congress
            did this to “regulate” the value of silver to gold according to the
            then current and prevailing free-market exchange ratios of the two
            metals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
            we have previously seen, this is one of the inherent complications
            or problems with a bimetallic system of coinage that “fixes” a statutory
            exchange ratio between silver and gold, as opposed to letting the
            free market forces of supply and demand determine the correct ratio.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            House Select Committee even debated this exact issue on the floor
            of the house. It was noted that the real purpose of the mint is only
            to assure that the coin stamped was of a certain weight and fineness.
            If that weight were stamped in figures or numbers – as opposed to “dollars” – it
            would be all that is needed – the free market could then be left
            to decide the appropriate exchange ratios.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
            representative Gorham stated, “go into the market; there the average
            of demand and supply would be accurately fixed, and there only”.
            If Congress had followed his advice, there is the strong possibility
            that we would not have the present monetary mess of irredeemable
            paper fiat currency that we currently have.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Which
            begs the questions we have previously mentioned: why didn’t Congress
            listen to such wise advice? And why did Congress ever construct and
            allow a bimetallic coinage system that included such an inherent
            flaw? Was it just an oversight – or sight deceptively focused? And
            once again – who was doing the focusing? And on what “mark” or goal?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#006699"><br>
  COINAGE ACT OF 1837</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Act of 1837 changed the purity ratio of both silver and gold coin
            to 900:1000 or 9/10ths purity. The new ratio changed the total metal
            grains of a silver dollar coin to 412.5, but did not alter the original
            silver content of 371.25.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Eagle at 9/10ths purity of 258 total grains was 232.2 grains of pure
            gold, keeping it within .086% of its value of the Act of 1834.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Note
            that up to this time, although the above two acts did cause gold
            coin to once again circulate as currency, especially when coupled
            together with the California gold rush – technically or statutorily
            the Nation was still on the constitutional silver standard – although
            a “populist” gold standard was beginning to be “favored” and used.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#006699"><br>
  COINAGE ACT OF 1849</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Coinage Act of 1849 created the first true “gold dollar” which contained
            25.8 grains of total metal and maintained the purity ratio of 900:1000.
            The Act also created the famous Double Eagle or $20 gold piece.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
            although a gold dollar now existed, as well as a $20 dollar gold
            piece – the United States was still on the Constitutional Silver
            Standard – which <b><i>cannot</i></b> be changed without a constitutional
            amendment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congress
            had been very careful in their wording of this act <i>not</i> to
            change the constitutional definition of a dollar as being a specific
            weight of silver, as the act reads: the new “gold dollar”, not as
            a “dollar”, or the “dollar”, but as being “of the value of one dollar”.
            It must be admitted – they were clever.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Once
              again, the above is not mere semantics; it is about the explicit
              definitions of very important and subtle issues – issues of constitutionality – issues
              as to just what “money” and “dollar” refer to, according to the
              Constitution. It is by such subtle changes, that certain “interests” have
              gained control of our monetary system – ever so slowly, ever so
              methodically, ever so deceitfully, and ever so destructively.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Thus
            the Constitutional definition of a dollar was still in effect, but
            now there was a gold dollar that had the <i>value</i> of the original
            constitutional dollar, which was still defined as the silver dollar
            of 371.25 grains of silver. The battle between silver and gold was
            heating up.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#006699"><br>
  COINAGE ACT OF 1853</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            act provided for a new “half dollar” of 192 grains, 9/10ths pure
            silver. This meant that two coins contained 345 – 3/5 grains of pure
            silver – 93.1% of the “value” of the original constitutional silver
            dollar. However, Congress limited the full legal tender of these
            coins to payment of debts not exceeding 5 dollars.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Thus
            Congress had placed these “subsidiary” coins “not on the same footing” as
            the other coins. The given reason for minting these new half dollars
            was that since the coinage act of 1834 had changed the legal exchange
            ratio between silver and gold to 16 to 1 (from 15 to 1), gold coin
            had re-entered into circulation as planned.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
            it was originally believed that gold would also continue to appreciate
            against silver. With the advent of the large discoveries of gold
            in California and Australia more supply came onto the market and
            gold depreciated compared to silver.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Moneychangers
            could make easy profits by melting down silver coins, and exporting
            the resulting bullion abroad. Silver coins were now ceasing to circulate.
            In an attempt to alleviate this situation, Congress minted the new “subsidiary” silver
            half dollars.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
            type of legislation provides more hints that behind the scenes or
            halls of Congress, was lurking the idea of moving to a “gold standard”.
            Discussions in the Congressional Records from this time support such
            a view. First gold had been forced out, now silver was under attack.</font></p>

  CONCLUSIONS OF COINAGE ACTS TO DATE</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">From
            1792 up until the advent of the Civil War, Congress had fairly consistently
            followed the monetary policy of the Constitution. Although several
            changes had been made to the original system as stated in the Coinage
            Act of 1792, some of the changes being obviously questionable in
            regards to both their common sense and intent, still none had parted
            too far astray from the original policy of 1792.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congress
            had followed the directive to coin money: of silver, gold and copper
            metal. The standard and definition of the dollar remained the Silver
            Dollar, as expressed by its intrinsic value in weight and fineness – 371.25
            grains of silver.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">But
            very subtle changes can be seen taking place, changes that would
            bear the bitter fruit of even greater and graver consequences: of
            irredeemable paper fiat and never-ending debt.</font></p>

  THE 1869 ACT TO STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC CREDIT</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">This
              seldom discussed Act, when coupled or taken together with subsequent
              Coinage Acts of 1873, 1878, 1890 and 1900 (as will be shown), is
              so revealing of the prevailing collusion between government legislation
              and the elite moneyed interests; and of their behind the scene
              efforts to create a credit based system of commerce and industry,
              by funding the currency with interest bearing bonds; thereby creating
              a permanent public debt, with a perpetual interest rate debt service
              stream to enrich themselves, at “We The People’s” peril and loss;
              that a quote of the entire Act is called for:</span></font></p>

              order to remove any doubt as to the purpose of the government to
              discharge all just obligations to the public creditors, and to
              settle conflicting questions and interpretations of the laws by
              virtue of which such obligations have been contracted, it is hereby
              provided and</span> <span style=" font-weight: normal">declared
              that the faith of the United States is solemnly pledged to the
              payment in coin, or its equivalent, of all the obligations of the
              United States not bearing interest, known as United States notes,
              and of all the interest-bearing obligations of the United States,
              except in cases where the law authorizing the issue of any such
              obligation has expressly provided that the same may be paid in
              lawful money or other currency than gold or silver. But none of
              said interest-bearing obligations not already due shall be redeemed
              or paid before maturity, unless at such time United States notes
              shall be convertible into coin at the option of the holder, or
              unless at such time bonds of the United States bearing a lower
              rate of interest than the bonds to be redeemed can be sold at par
              in coin. And the United States also solemnly pledges its faith
              to make provision at the earliest practicable period for the redemption
              of the United States notes in coin.&quot;</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">What
              this Act does, is to enhance the value of the Treasury Bonds that
              Congress had issued in 1862-1864 to fund the Civil War (soon to
              be examined), that were sold at a deep discount of upwards to 50%,
              because of their sale and redeemability in Greenbacks.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Furthermore,
              the Act raises the value of the Greenbacks, by pledging to redeem
              them in coin – as opposed to the original Greenback issuance, that
              although they stated, “payable to bearer”, were </span><i>not</i><span style=" font-weight: normal"> actually
              redeemable in coin, as the government had <i>suspended</i> <i>specie
              redemption</i> until 1875-79.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">When
              taken together with the above referenced monetary Acts, it is evident
              that the elite moneyed interests were having their cake and eating
              it as well – while the common man paid the tab. As will shortly
              be shown, the elite international banking cartel was the buyer
              of most of the bonded debt, using one August Belmont – the Rothschild’s
              American agent, as the middleman.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Of
              particular interest, is that at this time, Mr. Belmont was the
              Chairman of the National Democratic Committee; and became involved
              in the very messy issue of what amounted to the very purposeful
              and intended “defrocking” of their Presidential candidate, just
              weeks prior to the election.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">The
              resulting (and intended, at least by the money powers) elected
              candidate was none other than President Grant. It is one of the
              most amazing coincidences in history, that the new President’s <i>first</i> official
              act, signed into law, upon being sworn into office, was: The 1869
              Act To Strengthen The Public Credit! It should have been named,
              The 1869 Act To Enrich The International Banking Cartel.</span></font></p>

  COINAGE ACT OF 1873</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">In
              the Coinage Act of 1873, Congress for the very first time stated
              that gold coins of the “one-dollar piece”, which contained 23-22/100

              previously shown, however, the Constitutional “dollar” was a specific
              silver coin of a standard weight and fineness. Without a Constitutional
              amendment to change the original standard, the Coinage Act of 1873
              that purports to effect such change, is undeniably unconstitutional.</span></font></p>

              appear that this act demonetized silver coinage, although unconstitutionally;
              and placed the new gold dollar at the head of the class as the
              standard – but did it?</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">Well,
              not exactly – as it seems that “someone” thought of covering their
              butt – for the following verbiage is part and parcel of the Act: “…this
              act shall not be construed to affect any act done, right accrued,
              or penalty incurred, under former acts, but every such right is
              hereby saved”, even if such “acts done” and “rights accrued” were “inconsistent” with
              the 1873 Act.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">All
              of which basically means that we were still technically (statutorily)
              on the Constitutional Silver Standard, but practically (as in usage)
              on the new gold standard – so although the powers that be were
              trying to make it appear, through illusion and delusion, that silver
              had been demonetized – in truth it had not.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" font-weight: normal">However,
              such false beliefs or lies, when told often enough, for long enough – end
              up becoming the accepted state of how the general public perceives
              things to be, which was the intended goal of those that were manipulating
              the “appearances”, by the various “changes” we have seen implemented
              throughout our monetary history – showing that our monetary policy
              has devolved, not evolved, and that unseen hands were guiding such
              change.</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Of
            particular interest in regards to the Coinage Act of 1873, which
            arguably has the infamous distinction of being the first unconstitutional
            coinage act passed by Congress, is the question as to who was the “author” or
            guiding hand behind the act? None other that Senator John Sherman.
            But was he under the influence of “others?”</font></p>

  THE BATTLE FOR SILVER</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Under
            the Constitutional system of free coinage of silver and gold coin,
            the elite international banking cartel could not control the money – and
            thus could not control the country.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            life blood of the international bankers is credit, debt, and interest – as
            issued by paper money and debt obligations – <b><i>especially</i></b> government
            debt obligations that can be monetized and circulated as the currency
            in use.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS">The
            moneyed interests of London and New York viewed silver as a powerful
            enemy. New discoveries of large Western silver mines worried the
            elite bankers: that a proliferation of silver coin would deny them,
            what they believed, was their inherent birthright: to control the
            People’s money. Such beliefs run rampant in the blueblood of “royal” aristocracy,
            providing toxic effects that poison the unwary host, with delusions
            of superiority over his fellow man.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Subsequently,
            the position taken by this monopoly was a conspiracy to demonetize
            silver. This would enable the moneyed interests to maintain their
            grasp on the property of the people. And this war was not being fought
            just in our country, but in Europe as well – home to the cartel’s
            place of birth and origin.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Part
            of this plan entailed a fight to be waged against the standard silver
            dollar, which was correctly seen to be the symbol and standard of
            Honest Money; in order to sustain the supremacy of the London and
            New York bankers as the great moneychangers and powerbrokers of the
            world.</font></p>

  SENATOR SHERMAN</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">From
            1862 until 1873, senator John Sherman was the chairman of the finance
            committee. Through his hands passed the legislation that controlled
            the finances of our country. He was unquestionably the predominating
            financial powerbroker within the government at the time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Napoleon
            III, the Emperor of France, on the 4th of January 1867, extended
            an invitation to all the powers, including the United States, to
            hold a conference in Paris, for the purpose of extending the principles
            of the Latin Union throughout the commercial world.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Senator
            Sherman, upon receipt of the invitation of the Emperor Napoleon,
            visited London in the spring of 1867, just prior to the convening
            of this monetary conference. After consulting with the London bankers
            and financiers, he went to Paris where the conference was to be held.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
            a letter to a Mr. Ruggles, the U.S. representative appointed by the
            Secretary of State to attend the Paris conference, Senator Sherman
            had this to say:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Our
            gold dollar is certainly as good a unit of value as the franc, and
            so the English think of their pound sterling. These coins are now
            exchangeable only at a considerable loss, and this exchange is a
            profit only to brokers and bankers. Surely each commercial nation
            should be willing to yield a little to secure a gold coin of equal
            value, weight, and diameter, from whatever mint it may have been
            issued.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">As
            the gold 5-franc piece is now in use by over 60,000,000 of people
            of several different nationalities, and is of convenient form and
            size, it may well be adopted by other nations as the common standard
            of value; leaving to each nation to regulate the divisions of this
            unit in silver coins or tokens.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">If
            this is done France will surely abandon the impossible effort of
            making two standards of value. Gold coins will answer all the purposes
            of European commerce. A common gold standard will regulate silver
            coinage, of which the United States will furnish the greater part,
            especially for the Chinese trade.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">It
            would seem that the good Senator was strongly in favor of a gold
            standard, as opposed to the constitutionally mandated silver standard,
            which without a constitutional amendment would be unconstitutional – all
            as a ways and means towards an <i>international </i>standard of money.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">At
            the Paris financial conference, the international bankers, using
            the influence of England and the United States, through the personage
            of John Sherman, succeeded in defeating the adoption of a bimetallic
            standard, and a single standard of gold was agreed upon by the conference.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Upon
            returning to the United States, Senator Sherman introduced bill #
            217, titled “A Bill in Relation to Gold and Silver” to the fortieth
            Congress. Within the first draft of the bill, Sherman recommended
            that silver be demonetized and a new gold standard be put in place.
            The bill was shot down and never passed. The year was 1867.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">On
            April 28, 1870, Senator Sherman introduced a new bill to Congress.
            It was never stated that the bill proposed any major changes in the
            coinage system – let alone changing the constitutional standard from
            silver to gold, which it did propose. Instead, it was euphemistically
            called: “A bill revising the laws relative to the mint, assay office,
            and coinage of the United States.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">I
            will not bore the reader with all the details of the passage of this
            bill, which included amendments, changes, the renumbering of sections
            of the bill to confuse the contents; to the contrived agreement <i>not</i> to
            read the final bill before the House, but to waver having the bill
            read; and to simply vote on its passage, as the bill was purposefully
            not brought up for discussion and vote until the end of the session.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            following words of William S. Holman sums it up most concisely: &quot;I
            have before me the record of the proceedings of this House on the
            passage of that measure, a record which no man can read without being
            convinced that the measure and the method of its passage through
            this House was a `colossal swindle.' I assert that the measure never
            had the sanction of this House, and it does not possess the moral
            force of law.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">There
            is much more that could be said on this one subject – enough to fill
            a book, suffice it to say that what has been offered is sufficient
            evidence that a battle between the moneychangers and powerbrokers
            of the world for control of the People’s money and possessions has
            been and still is – raging on; and that their influence had infiltrated
            the halls of Congress.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            demonetization of silver will be seen to be just one part of the
            plan to place the United States and the world on a gold backed standard,
            to be followed by a totally fiat paper system; all carefully planned
            and orchestrated steps to bring about a global system of paper currencies;
            with the final goal of a one world fiat currency – founded and based
            on a system of perpetual credit and debt of “We The People” – a system
            no less oppressive, then the bondage of feudal slavery and tyranny.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            idea was borne in infamy, by the elite international bankers, and
            then pedaled to the United States, Germany, France, and the rest
            of Europe. The war reparations that France had to pay were involved,
            as well as foreign trade with India and China, and other eastern
            nations that were on a silver standard, and the effects all this
            had on foreign “exchange” and trade, especially to the international
            elite of England and Lombard Street. As Baron Rothschild once said, “I
            care not who is King or Queen, as long as I control the money.”</font></p>

  COINAGE ACT OF 1878</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Coinage Act of 1878 authorized Congress to restore the coinage of
            the standard silver dollar of the weight of 371.25 grains of silver,
            and to make it legal tender, as stated in the Act of 1837. However,
            there were some distinct and most curious additions written into
            the statute.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Act mandated that <b><i>Congress </i></b><i>was to purchase</i> the
            silver to be minted, in stated amounts on a monthly basis. This is <i>not</i> free
            coinage as established in the Constitution. And such actions beg
            the question: buy the silver with what?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">From
            the Coinage Act of 1878 we read:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">&quot;Be
            it enacted, etc, That there shall be coined, at the several mints
            of the United States, silver dollars of the weight of 412 - 1/2 grains
            troy of standard silver, as provided in the act of January 18, 1837,
            on which shall be the devices and superscriptions provided by said
            act; which coins, together with all silver dollars heretofore coined
            by the United States, of like weight and fineness, shall be a legal
            tender, at their nominal value, for all debts and dues, public and
            private, except where otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">And
            the secretary of the treasury is authorized and directed to purchase,
            from time to time, silver bullion at the market price thereof, not
            less than $2,000,000 worth per month nor more than $4,000,000 worth
            per month, and cause the same to be coined monthly, as fast as so
            purchased, into such dollars; and a sum sufficient to carry out the
            foregoing provision of this act is hereby appropriated out of any
            money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated. And any gain or
            seigniorage arising from this coinage shall be accounted for and
            paid into the treasury, as provided under existing laws relative
            to the subsidiary coinage: Provided, That the amount of money at
            any one time invested in such silver billion, exclusive of such resulting
            coin, shall not exceed $5,000,000; And provided further, That nothing
            in this act shall be construed to authorize the payment in silver
            of certificates of deposit issued under the provisions of section
            254 of the Revised Statutes.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Such
            was a <i>far cry</i> from the constitutional free coinage system
            that simply provided a government mint, whereby silver and gold bullion
            were converted into coin – silver and gold that was already owned
            and the property of the <b><i>private</i></b> individuals that brought
            the metals to the mint – <b><i>not</i> </b>silver and gold purchased
            and <i>owned</i> by the <b><i>government</i>.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
            meant that the <i>government held title to the silver</i>, and had
            paid for it with the issuance of government debt or notes – which
            basically means that “We The People” were indebted or obliged to
            pay the tab. Things were starting to get very interesting, to say
            the least – ever so subtly, ever more boldly, ever more effectively.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Not
            only were the rules being changed as to the ownership of the silver
            (government held title), but now there were also minimal and maximum
            limits as to the amount of silver to be purchased by the Treasury.
            At the lower limit of $2,000,000 worth of silver being purchased
            per month, such would give a yearly total of $24,000,000. Adding
            the $5,000,000 the Act allowed to ever be held in bullion at any
            one time, prior to minting into coin; a limited total of $29 million
            worth of silver was possible.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
            effectively meant, that the Treasury, when and if it wanted to, could <i>limit</i> the
            minting of silver to $29 million. Also, the yearly production of
            silver at this time was almost <i>twice</i> this amount. This placed
            the fox in charge of guarding the chickens; by granting control to
            the Treasury, of the limits of the supply and demand factors of silver;
            and hence the price of silver.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Without
            doubt, this was <b><i>not</i></b> in keeping with <b><i>free </i></b>coinage
            of the Constitution. But why would the Treasury want to do this? – The
            plot thickens; the waters are becoming even more clouded and murky.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Treasury also issued silver certificates for not less than ten standard
            silver dollars. This was the first issuance of silver certificates,
            and arguably an unconstitutional act of emitting bills of credit,
            as nowhere does the Constitution grant Congress the power of acting
            as a deposit bank.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Act also authorized the President to confer with foreign governments
            to adopt a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose
            of establishing an international system of money. The idea of an <i>international</i> monetary
            system is most thought provoking, especially as The Constitution
            does not mention it anywhere.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As
            always, Senator Sherman seemed to raise more questions or issues
            then he ever answered. One such question is why did Sherman, while
            Secretary of the U.S. Treasury in 1878, authorize the sub-treasury
            department (a dept. of the U.S. government that held federal deposits)
            to become a member of the Clearing House Association, which was the
            organization of the major national banks of the elite moneyed powers;
            knowing as he did, that the Clearing House Association did <b><i>not</i> </b>accept
            silver dollars or silver certificates in settlement of balances due
            from member banks?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Another
            provocative question is why did Secretary Sherman, in late 1878,
            issue an executive order to various ports of the United States, directing
            them to accept as payment for duties on imports, both Treasury Notes
            and U.S. Notes – knowing that the Act of 1862 that issued them – <b><i>prohibited </i></b>such?
            It would appear, that unseen hands were providing “guidance” – but
            towards what end?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS">All
            in all, although silver had rightfully been returned to its place
            as the standard, it also seems that yet another turn had been taken
            down the road to perdition – of monetary devolution towards our present
            state of irredeemable paper fiat – all acts being but precursors
            for a new world order of money and power. The art of illusion and
            delusion is seen to be the weapon of choice, as the ever subtle,
            ever destructive changes keep adding up, slowly draining the life
            blood of Honest Money, as originally stated in the Constitution.</font></p>

  SILVER PURCHASE ACT OF 1890</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Silver Purchase Act of 1890 continues further down the slippery path
            of the debasement of our monetary system. Although it appeared to
            be less radical then the previous Act of 1878, by repealing portions
            of the Act of 1878, the Act of 1890 actually contained even more
            questionable legislative provisions, especially in regards to their
            efficacy to succeed upon implementation; which provides yet more
            evidence that they were <i>not</i> intended to be put into successful
            practice at all, but were intended to “<i>fail</i>”, so as to dishonor
            the use of silver coinage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            Act stated that the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase
            silver bullion to the aggregate amount of 4,500,000 ounces, or as
            much thereof as would be offered in each month at the market price,
            not exceeding $1 for each 371.25 grains of pure silver.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Treasury
            notes of the United States were to be issued in payment for such
            purchases. The Treasury notes so issued were redeemable on demand,
            in coin, at the Treasury of the United States, or at the office of
            any assistant treasurer of the United States, and, when so redeemed,
            could be reissued.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS">But
            the Act also stated: “but no greater or less amount of such notes
            shall be outstanding at any time than the cost of the silver bullion
            and the standard silver dollars coined therefrom, <b><i>then held
            in the Treasury purchased by such notes.”</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Further
            on the Acts says, “That the Secretary of the Treasury shall each
            month coin 2,000,000 ounces of the silver bullion purchased under
            the provisions of this act into standard silver dollars until the
            first day of July, 1891, and after that time he shall coin of the
            silver bullion purchased under the provisions of this act as much
            as may be necessary to provide for the redemption of the Treasury
            notes herein provided for.”</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS">So,
            when we put these two provisions together we find that the government
            is to purchase silver bullion, from which silver coins were to be
            minted, said bullion to be purchased with Treasury Notes, and said
            silver coins were to be <b><i>held in the Treasury for the redemption
            of such notes.</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Once
            again, the is not the <i>free</i> coinage of the original Constitutional
            system – the government is buying the silver with the People’s money
            by issuing Treasury bonded debt, and furthermore, the silver was
            being held on account for redemption of the notes, which meant that
            most of the silver would <b><i>not be put into circulation as currency</i></b>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Also,
            note in the first section where it says, “purchase silver bullion… not
            exceeding one dollar for each 371-1/4 fine grains”. So an <i>upper</i> price
            limit has been set, but not a <i>lower</i> price limit. Maybe that’s
            why the next section mentions, “any seigniorage arising from such
            coinage is to be paid into the Treasury.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">And
            finally there is the section that reads, “Redeem such notes in gold
            or silver coin, at his (Treasury Secretary’s) discretion”. Note the
            use of the word “or”, as opposed to “and.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">I
            will leave it up to the reader to decide if this sounds like its
            was silver friendly free coinage for “We The People”, or something
            else of a more sinister nature, as what affect would and did such
            policy have? Was silver being purposefully, albeit clandestinely,
            tarnished in gold’s favor?</font></p>

  COINAGE ACT OF 1890</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
            coinage act of 1890 called for the prohibition of the minting of
            the one dollar gold piece, stating, “the piece shall not be struck
            or issued by the Mint of the United States.” The provisions of the
            act also stipulated that the current circulation of the coins was
            to be called in and withdrawn and that “all laws and parts of laws
            in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Essentially,
            not only did this act demonetize the gold dollar, but it also repealed
            and ended the gold dollar as being “the unit of value”, or statutory
            standard of the monetary system of coinage – hence ending the short
            lived “gold standard”, as declared in the coinage act of 1873.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Yet
            another 180 degree turn in the long and winding road of our monetary
            history, intended to confuse and hide the final destination. What
            could possibly lie ahead?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#006699"><br>
  COINAGE ACT OF 1900</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Once
            again, Congress turned 180 degrees and now defined by statute that
            the standard of our monetary system was to be the gold dollar, stating:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Be
            it enacted… That the dollar consisting of twenty-five and eight-tenths
            grains of gold nine-tenths fine, as established by section thirty-five
            hundred and eleven of the Revised Statutes of the United States,
            shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued
            or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity of
            value with this standard, and it shall be the duty of the Secretary
            of the Treasury to maintain such parity.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
            is the “gold standard” usually mentioned in most (but not all) writings
            and articles on the subject. Congress declared that “the dollar consisting
            of 23-22/100 grains of fine gold, as established by the Coinage Act
            of 1873”, was to be the “standard unit of value”.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">So
            once again Congress declares the gold dollar to be the standard.
            Buried within the many provisions of the Act of 1900, however, are
            several issues that raise perhaps more questions then they answered.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
            section III we read: “That nothing contained in this Act shall be
            construed to affect the legal tender quality as now provided by law
            of the silver dollar, or of any other money coined or issued by the
            United States”.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Elsewhere
            it was stated, “all forms of money issued or coined by the United
            States shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
            light of the above two sanctions the following provisions are most
            curious. We find it stated that the United States Notes (Greenbacks)
            and Treasury Notes are no longer to be redeemed in either silver
            or gold coin, but only in gold of the new standard, thus excluding
            silver.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Next – what
            basically amounts to a general refunding of the national debt is
            stated – as existing outstanding bonds that were previously payable “in
            coin” (both silver &amp; gold) – were now to be exchangeable for
            new bonds that were payable in gold only.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">And
            finally, the act also authorized the issuance of silver and gold
            certificates, however, once again we find a most curious and puzzling
            provision – the prohibition of the gold certificates from being used
            for private debts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">If
            the purpose was to confuse the understanding – by illusion, delusion
            and pure deceit – the guiding hand was most adept. And who provided
            the guiding hand of this Act – none other than Senator Nelson Aldrich – whom
            we will see also guided the Federal Reserve Act into fruition.</font></p>

  SUMMARY OF THE STANDARD OF 1900</font></b></font></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                one dollar gold coin was by statute the “standard”, meaning a “gold
                standard.”</font>         
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">All
                forms of money (which would include the silver dollar) were to
                be kept at a parity of value with the new standard.</font>         
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
                meant that 23-22/100 grains of fine gold (the new one dollar
                gold standard) was at parity (equal) to the original silver dollar
                of 371-1/4 grains of silver.</font>         
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Essentially
            what this meant was that Congress by statute had “changed” the standard
            from silver to gold and kept their value equal or at parity; and
            that although a populist or practical usage of gold had been put
            in place, the original constitutional standard of silver was still
            in effect; as without a constitutional amendment, which has never
            been passed – “an unconstitutional act or law is as if it never occurred
            or had been passed – and is null and void.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">So
            the “gold standard” of 1900 was not the monometallic gold standard
            that many claim or believe it to be. It was just another form of
            what had always been a very “back and forth” duometallic standard
            of silver and gold. But as we have seen, this was by subtle design – not
            by mistake or accident. The intended goal of a pure paper fiat currency
            that monetized all government debt was lurking in the shadows, waiting
            to be unveiled.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Of
            intriguing interest and particularity, are the discussions and provisions
            within the act dealing with Treasury Notes and Bonds and United States
            Notes. It seems like an awful lot of talk about paper and debt was
            involved for an act that was purported to establish a “gold standard”.
            What was all this “talk” really about?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Senator
            Bate seemed to know what all the talk of notes and bonds was about,
            as he had this to say during the Congressional debates on the Act
            of 1900:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS">&nbsp;“It
            was essentially provided in the National Bank law that they should
            take these bonds of the United States – not State bonds or corporation
            bonds, but bonds of the United States – upon which they are to base
            their operations. That is now essential. They had, exclusive of the
            (1894-95) bonds, $685,000.000. How many banks are there in the United
            States? More than 3,500, with a paid in capital of more than $605,000.000.
            So when the bonds due in 1907 are taken up, there will be but little
            left to bank on. <b><i>Therefore the banks must have more bonds</i></b><i>.</i></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS">&nbsp;They
            seek in this bill to renew the life of the bonds. They make it a

            banks may flourish under existing laws. <i>That is one of the main
            secrets of this bill.<b> </b>The banks are at the back and bottom
            of it.”</i></font></p>

  BY DESIGN OR MISTAKE</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
            have seen that our original constitutional standard was silver with
            a bimetallic coinage system of gold and silver. The original constitutional “dollar” was
            a silver dollar.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Over
            the course of our history, we have also seen that Congress went back
            and forth from favoring first one metal and then the other – with
            acts to demonetize one metal and then the other. Upon close scrutiny
            it “appears” to be quite a confused and misunderstood and applied
            system – adopting first one set of rules and then another, then returning
            back to the original and so on. But appearances can be deceiving.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">All
            of which indicates that either none of our elected representatives
            for almost 200 years understood monetary theory and how to apply
            it to implement a workable monetary policy; or – what other choice
            are we left with? Perhaps there is an explanation that works, but
            the question is: for whom does it work?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
            have seen that “We The People” established and ordained the Constitution,
            which in turn created Congress, granting them certain explicit delegations
            of power in order to form a more perfect “Union”: of and for – “We
            The People.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">But
            we have also seen that there is an elite moneyed interest that is
            always at odds with the Constitution and the People – and continually
            tries to, and does, circumvent the Supreme Law of The Land; in order
            to establish <i>its order</i> over and above the People, by slowly
            gaining control of monetary policy and then all trade and commerce.
            So just exactly “who are these guys?”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">We
            have thus far only seen their minions at work, as “they” choose to
            remain in the shadows. Let’s cast some light on the shadows and see
            who is lurking therein. First we will examine the most important
            Treasury note issuances, as this will provide additional background
            for an easier understanding of the unseen guiding hands. As has been

                8, Clause 2</u> of
                the Constitution grants Congress the power “to borrow money”.
                During several occasions in the 1800s, Congress used the power
                to borrow money by issuing Treasury Notes, which were paper claims
                of public indebtedness.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
              keeping with the constitutional mandate against “emitting bills of credit”,
              all but one series of Treasury Notes, until the Civil War, were
              issued
              accordingly: without creating any type of paper currency with legal
              tender authorization.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              Civil War changed, however, what had been up until that time, a
              faithful record of
              Congress in regards to the power to “borrow money”. This change
              left the door open for the moneychangers to enter into the temple,
              and disgrace the hallowed halls.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              elite collectivists had their paws all over private banking, but
              now they were after
              bigger game: the control of the government’s note issue as well,
              as this would give them even more leverage to perpetuate the servitude
              of the People, using the chains of national bonded debt.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">But
              they are a most patient group; decades are insignificant in their
              quest for power,
              extending their dominion and rule over nations and continents for
              centuries to come. They respect no bounds and accept few rules – such
              are the masters of the universe, at least as perceived within the

              cause for the first issue of Treasury Notes, at least the first
              significant amount. From 1812 to 1814 Congress emitted four series
              of notes, basically all with the same stipulations.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              Treasury Notes were designed not to circulate as currency. The
              following short
              synopsis of the basic provisions illustrates this point most clearly:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                  notes could be issued only to persons who “may choose” to receive
                  them. </font></li>
            <li>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The notes paid
                  interest (which makes them almost impossible to circulate as
                  currency).            </font></li>
            <li>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
                  notes were not payable to bearer, but had to be transferred
                  by endorsement only.            </font></li>
            <li>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The notes could
                  not be reissued.            </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
              was all in keeping with the Constitution. Further proof that to
              do otherwise would
              be straying from the Constitution, is a resolution placed before
              the House in 1814, which stated: “the Treasury notes which may
              be issued… shall be a legal tender in all debts due”. The resolution
              was voted down 95 to 42. It seems that some Congressmen understood
              the Constitution.</font></p>

            TREASURY NOTES OF 1815</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congress parted from
              the path of the Constitution with the note issue of 1815, which
              included the provision that certain denominations of notes (less
              than $100) were payable to the bearer; transferable by mere delivery;
              paid no interest; and could be reissued. The question of the notes
              constitutionality was never raised, although a later series in
              1844, based on the same provisions, was ruled to be unconstitutional.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#006699"><b><br>
            JOINT RESOLUTION OF 1816</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              provisions of the resolution of 1816 provides clear evidence that
              Congress was
              fully aware of the difference between bills of credit and legal
              currency; and that it did not consider that Treasury Notes were
              legal currency – let alone a constitutional form of money. As stated
              in the Resolution:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">&quot;…that
              the Secretary of the Treasury be required and directed to adopt
              measures to cause all duties, taxes, debts, or sums of money, accruing
              or becoming payable to the United States, to be collected and paid
              in the legal currency of the United States, or treasury notes,
              or notes of the bank of the United States, or in notes of the bank
              of the
              United States, or in notes of banks which are payable and paid
              on demand in the said legal currency of the United States.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Clearly
              evident from the above wording, legal currency was distinctly set
              off from treasury
              notes by the use of the word “or”. Also included as distinct from
              legal currency by the self-same use of the word “or”, were notes
              of the bank of the United States, and “in” notes of the bank of
              the United States.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">So
              what was the legal currency of the United States referenced in
              the resolution? According
              to the detailed listing of the several non-legal forms of currency,
              by process of elimination – silver and gold coin were the only
              candidates left standing as legal currency: a most clandestine
              declaration and testimony to Honest Money.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In 1817, Congress
              decided to repeal all authority to issue Treasury Notes. The rights
              of individuals that held pre-existing notes were kept intact. The
              next issue would not occur for twenty years.</font></p>

  TREASURY NOTES FROM 1837 – 1843</font></b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              various note issues of this period were very similar to the earlier
              ones, in regards
              to their adherence to the Constitutional power to “borrow money”,
              as distinct from the express prohibition not to emit bills of credit
              that could circulate as legal tender currency. One slight exception
              was that some of the bills could be reissued under limited circumstances.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Providing more proof
              that Congress was very aware that only silver and gold were legal
              tender, as opposed to any type of paper money, was the following
              wording in the general appropriations acts of 1834 and 1835:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Nothing
              herein contained shall be construed to make any thing but gold
              and silver a tender in payment, of any debt due from the United
              States to individuals.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#006699"><b><br>
            TREASURY NOTES OF 1844</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              Treasury Notes of 1843-1844 were the most significant of all. Congress
              declared
              that certain new notes, that were to be issued to redeem outstanding
              notes, that were presently paying interest above the then current
              market rate of interest, were “payable in coin at par on presentation.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The House of Representatives
              rightly questioned the constitutionality of these Notes. The Ways
              and Means Committee investigated the issue, including questioning
              and receiving the written opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury,
              on his reasoning behind the provision under review.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">After
              a very thorough investigation, the committee clearly expressed
              that the power to
              borrow was distinct from any possible or supposed power to emit
              bills of credit. The committee also correctly established, that
              although bills of credit were unconstitutional, this prohibition
              did not prevent Congress from issuing “paper” (i.e. constitutional
              treasury notes), if the “paper” issued was only written evidence
              of the loan – not a medium of exchange intended to circulate as
              legal tender currency.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              above ruling was one of the more enlightened and clear-headed moments
              of our elected
              officials. Today’s monetary officials would do well to emulate
              such financial understanding and patriotic valor.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The last three series
              of Treasury Notes prior to the Civil War were in accordance with
              the standard constitutional format, including the various provisions
              that precluded them from circulating as a legal tender medium of
              exchange or paper currency.</font></p>

            SUMMARY OF PRE-CIVIL WAR TREASURY NOTES</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">As we have seen, in
              all of the many issuances of Treasury Notes from 1812 through 1860,
              Congress faithfully followed the letter of the Constitution in
              regards to the power to borrow money per <u>Article I, Section
              8, Clause 2</u> on all but two occasions: the first being the 1815
              issue and the second being the 1844 series.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
              the rejection in 1844 by the House of Representatives of the provision “payable
              to bearer”, including a House Resolution stating that such legislation
              was unconstitutional, and beyond the authorized power to “borrow
              money” – illustrated that Congress was clearly aware that the power
              to coin silver and gold as money, was explicitly distinct from
              the power to borrow money. And furthermore, that the power to borrow
              money did not include the power to emit bills of credit.</font></p>

  GREENBACKS &amp; THE LEGAL TENDER ACT OF 1862</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              devastation of the Civil War had the dreaded affect of changing
              Congress’ tradition
              of following the hard-money standard of our constitutional heritage:
              by issuing paper currency, although originally purported to be
              redeemable in specie, redemption in gold and silver was suspended
              until 1879.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The seeds were sown
              for the future plague of paper fiat and fractional reserve lending,
              evil twins that gave birth to a pestilence of wealth transference,
              by monetizing government debt and circulating it as legal tender
              currency. Such is the scourge of present day monetary policy.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In 1861, Congress
              tried to raise a 10 million dollar loan by issuing interest paying
              Treasury Notes to pay the costs of war. In its basic premises,
              these Notes were not constitutionally much different from preceding
              issues.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
              soon there followed Treasury Notes that were not only interest
              bearing; but
              notes that did not pay interest, and were payable on demand. These
              Notes were no different than the Treasury Notes of 1844 that Congress
              refused to accept for being unconstitutional. Precedent had now
              been set for the Greenbacks to come, and come they did.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon Chase, attempted the first large
              funding for the
              war in 1861, by floating a $150 million dollar bond issue to the
              nation’s leading banks. The bonds were supposed to be backed by
              specie, but the banks did not have the gold and silver on deposit.
              Once again, the banks suspended redemption in specie. The Treasury
              quickly followed suit on its Notes.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              allowance of irredeemable currency provided the excuse for the
              Legal Tender Act of 1862:
              authorizing Congress to issue $150 million in new Treasury Notes – called
              Greenbacks. The Greenbacks were made legal tender for all debts,
              both public and private. The one “redeeming” quality was that the
              interest on the notes was to be paid in specie.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Originally the Treasury
              said that this would be a one time occurrence; however, later that
              year another $150 million were issued and another $100 million
              the following year. The Act of 3 March 1863 was for $450 million.
              By the end of 1863, Congress had authorized the printing of $850
              million worth of Greenbacks.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Over
              the course of the War, the money supply increased from $45 million
              to $1.77 billion – an
              increase of almost 140%. Needless to say, prices of goods skyrocketed – prices
              at the end of the war were up over 110%. Unfortunately, inflation
              was alive and well, while the People suffered the burden.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Senator
              Sherman was a strong supporter of the Greenbacks, always reminding
              Congress: “The
              men who have loaned you money (bankers) are the very men who now
              beg you for this measure of financial aid”. The Senator was making
              a sales pitch for his favorite special interest group – the bankers.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Recall
              that redemption of bank notes in gold and silver had been suspended.
              With the passage
              of the Legal Tender Act, the banks could use the Greenbacks to
              redeem their own bank notes. Even better, they could use the Greenbacks
              as bank reserves, against which they could then issue their own
              paper bank notes and demand deposits.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The government was
              bailing out the banks, siphoning wealth from the People by the
              deceit of paper money; all built upon an inverted pyramid of debt.
              The Resumption of Specie Act was not passed until 1875, and was
              not put into effect until 1879.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">During
              hearings on the passage of the legal tender bill, Representative
              Conkling summed
              things up quite well when he stated, “this bill is a legislative
              declaration of national bankruptcy.” Now why would Representative
              Conkling say this? As he further explained:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“No
              precedent can be urged in its favor; no suggestion of the existence
              of such a power can be found in the legislative history of the
              country; and this amounts to affirmative authority of the highest
              kind against it. Had such a power lurked in the Constitution, as
              construed by those who ordained and administered it, or at least
              referring to it, has repeatedly arisen; and had such a power existed,
              it would have been recognized and acted upon. The uniform and universal
              judgment of statesmen, jurists, and lawyers has denied the constitutional
              right of Congress to make paper a legal tender for debts to any
              extent whatever.”</font></p>

            OF GREENBACKS</b></font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
              1867 the issue of the Greenback’s constitutionality as legal tender finally reached
              the Supreme Court in the case of Hepburn v. Griswold. The Court
              ruled the Legal Tender Acts invalid. Chief Justice Salmon Chase
              wrote the final decision, admitting that his actions as Secretary
              of the Treasury to pass the Legal Tender Acts was wrong, and he
              apologized for his “different views, never before entertained by
              American statesman or jurists.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Needless to say, the
              powers that be were not ecstatic over the decision. President Grant
              (he was the guy that passed the Act of 1869 to Restore The Public
              Credit) came to their rescue by appointing two new Supreme Court
              Justices. Both were lawyers for the major railroads who were one
              of the powers not happy with the ruling.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The Legal Tender Acts
              were revisited in the case of Knox v. Lee, resulting in a five
              to four majority reversal of the Hepburn v. Griswold case. President
              Grant proved to be a powerful ally to the elite international collectivists.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
              was a damaging and bitter defeat. The moneyed powers were gaining
              strength from
              the usurpation of the common man’s constitutional rights of Honest
              Money. Their new world order was beginning to be placed above The
              Supreme Law of the Land.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              Knox ruling essentially gave Congress the leeway to do whatever
              it thinks prudent to “preserve
              the government” – even if such actions include trampling over and
              undermining the Constitution. It was a sad moment in the affairs
              of man that would have grave consequences for decades to come.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Unfortunately,
              further progress down the ever-winding road of monetary debasement
              had
              taken place: the long desired precedent was finally in place. The
              creatures were breeding, the gates wide open; the writing on the
              wall: Charon knows not the foolish want that accepts the unacceptable;
              betwixt his teeth he tests the mettle of the coin; for the ferry
              so guided to the other shore.</font></p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="3">During
              the 17th century, American settlers were starting to grow from
              small colonies and villages into larger towns and cities. Barter
              was the earliest method of trade, the direct exchange of one good
              for another. Soon certain commodities became most favored, such
              as furs and tobacco. In Virginia, warehouse receipts for bales
              of tobacco circulated as money.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">As
                the colonies grew in size, so did their need for trade and commerce.
                The increased division of labor naturally progressed from direct
                exchange (barter), to indirect exchange: the use of a common
            medium – money.
                The discovery of new ports increased the number of ships from
            distant lands, bringing with them foreign gold and silver coins.
            English
                coins, French coins, and especially Spanish coins were becoming
              the money of choice.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Many
                authors have written about a shortage of money in colonial times.
                There was a deficiency of sound money, due to specific reasons,
                but a lack of money there was not. By the 1700’s, Colonial money
                included a diverse selection of media: gold and silver coins;
                book-credit; various commodity money substitutes, and several
                different types
              of paper notes.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><b><font color="#006699">EARLY
                  PAPER MONEY</font></b></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">During
                the mid to late 1600’s, Massachusetts would often send expeditions
                to the French settlements in Quebec to loot and plunder. These
                raids were usually quite successful and productive. The soldiers
              would return home, sell their booty for profit, and be content.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">In
                1690, after a particularly disastrous raid, soldiers returned
            to Boston in a foul mood – demanding to be paid. The government,
            not being in possession of the needed goods or coin, came up with
            the
                idea of printing paper notes, supposedly redeemable in gold and
                silver, to be procured from up and coming tax receipts. No further
                paper money was to be printed until the first issue had been
            paid off in specie.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Within
              a few months time the issue ran short, and the government printed
              another series of notes. It was quickly found out, that the purchasing
              power of the notes was rapidly declining compared to gold and silver
              coin. The people realized the paper would never be redeemed as
              promised.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">What
                did the government do to solve the dilemma? They resorted to
            one of the King’s favorite prerogatives: forced legal tender laws.
                Paper money was declared compulsory for all debts, and a 5% discount
              was offered for all government debts paid in paper.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Suddenly
              nearby States of Connecticut and Rhode Island began to issue paper
              money. The race was on. In 1716, Massachusetts decided to form
              a government land bank, and to issue notes backed by the land.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Prices
              on everything began to rise dramatically. The purchasing power
              of paper kept falling. Silver and gold coin had all but disappeared.
              This is the scarcity so often referred to, but it was a man-made
              scarcity of specie, caused by the excess emission of paper money,
              mandated to be legal tender for all debts. It was not<b> </b>a
              natural scarcity due to free market laws of supply and demand,
              but one of contrived government intervention.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">By
              1740, paper money had depreciated to near worthlessness compared
              to gold and silver coin. Massachusetts’s exchange rate was 11 to
              1; Connecticut’s was 9 to 1; Carolina’s 10 to 1; and the infamous “winner” was
              Rhode Island – with the unbelievable rate of 23 to 1. Inflation
              had come full circle in just 50 years.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">The
                following year, Parliament passed an act to restrict the various
                schemes within the American Colonies that involved paper money.
                In 1751 and 1764, Parliament passed acts to regulate and restrain
                bills of credit from being declared to be legal tender, in any
              of his Majesty’s Colonies.</font></p>

                OF NORTH AMERICA</b></font></p>
          </font>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              Bank of North America was chartered in 1782; the first government
              sanctioned central bank. Its home was Philadelphia. This was the
              first organized public institution of the elite moneyed interest.
              Robert Morris was appointed Financial Agent (Secretary of the Treasury)
              of the United States, so as to be able to oversee the operation
              of the Bank.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              government authorized the Bank of North America’s notes to be receivable
              for all duties and taxes for all governments; and they were to
              exchange at par with specie. No other bank of issue was permitted.
              In return for the government’s unprecedented largess of such limitless
              power of monopoly, the Bank of North America did what all patriotic
              bankers do: they offered to loan the government all the money it
              needed to finance the public debt with – while the American taxpayers
              paid the bill.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Robert
              Morris was an elite collectivist. He dreamed of a centralized government,
              with the power to tax its citizens, creating a system of perpetual
              government debt; all to be monetized by the fractional reserve
              lending of paper money. He submitted his plan to Congress and they
              approved, issuing the charter for “his” bank.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
              was a wealth transference system of the elite collectivists, which
              in Morris’s own words would be a windfall to speculators of public
              debt – at the expense of the taxpayers; that would cause “wealth
              to flow into the hands that could render it most productive”.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">An
              interesting side note: Morris was unable to raise the required
              specie reserves for the bank. As one of the prominent members of
              Congress and the Government’s Financial Agent, Morris was able
              to appropriate specie on loan from France to the United States,
              and invested it “for the government” in “his” own bank.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
              meant that the majority of specie capital for Morris’s bank came
              from government accounts. These funds were then borrowed back by
              Morris from the bank, under the ruse of being the Government’s
              Financial Agent; funneling the money into government contracts
              with his own personal business associates, to provide war provisions
              to the government. Why he wasn’t charged with embezzlement boggles
              the mind, and defies the most basic ideals of jurisprudence.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">By
              the end of 1783, the first experiment with a central bank had ended – badly,
              and the Bank of North America was closed down. Morris convinced
              his Philadelphia connections to issue him a state banking charter,
              and he quickly changed the bank over to a private commercial institution.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#006699">FIRST
                  BANK OF THE UNITED STATES</font></b></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of Alexander
              Hamilton, although not his first. In 1784, Hamilton had started
              the commercial Bank of New York, one of only three commercial banks
              in the country: the other two being Morris’s bank in Philadelphia
              and the Bank of Massachusetts in Boston. The strategic geographical
              location of the three banks was not by coincidence. This was the
              second public display of the elite moneyed interest.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Cut
              from the same cloth as Morris, Hamilton was a statist who believed
              in a centralized form of government that controlled all aspects
              of the country – especially money, banking and trade. Hamilton’s
              true reasons for wanting a central bank were revealed when he wrote:</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“All
              communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first
              are rich and wellborn, the other the mass of the people. The people
              are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right.”</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This
              aristocratic indifference to the lower orders of his fellow man
              is the signature of the elite collectivist, who views the masses
              as a tool to be used in their selfish quest for riches. Europe
              provided the spawning grounds for such elite ideology, purveyors
              of which included: Lord Rothschild and Adam Weishaupt; soon to
              be followed by Cecil Rhodes, Oxford Professor John Ruskin, and
              Lord Milner.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Under
              Hamilton’s direction, Congress chartered the First Bank of the
              United States in 1791. The First Bank was granted the monopoly
              of the coveted power to issue notes. The charter was for 20 years
              and no other national bank was permitted. The former partner of
              Robert Morris, Thomas Willing, was appointed president of the Bank.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Central
              banks attain their influence from the government’s sanction to
              emit paper bank notes that circulate as legal tender. This is key
              to their power. By establishing a central bank based upon fractional
              reserve lending, a system is created that allows for the use of
              book-entry loans and hence – money, a number of times greater than
              the actual money the bank has in reserves. In other words, they
              get to loan out money they do not have. By the magic powers of
              credit, money is created – from out of nothing, but the want, thereof.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
              1811, the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired.
              President Madison, another of the elite guard, fought hard to recharter
              the bank. Congress failed by only one vote to reissue a new charter.
              Thus ended the First Bank of the United States.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#006699"><b>SECOND
                BANK OF THE UNITED STATES</b></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Shortly
              after the closing of the First Bank of the United States, America
              found itself in the War of 1812. The sinews of war being money,
              huge sums were suddenly in demand. Private banks began to spring
              up overnight, issuing hoards of bank notes to pay for badly needed
              war supplies.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Although
              the banks issued paper money, it was supposedly redeemable in gold
              and silver. But the costs of war were overwhelming, and the banks
              succumbed to the excesses of the printing press: issuing notes
              they could neither honor or redeem.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congress
              made the fatal mistake of allowing the banks to suspend payment
              in specie for over two years, until 1817. The suspension of the
              redemption of paper in gold and silver set an evil precedent that
              still haunts our country to this very day – the curse of dishonest
              banking: the breaking of one’s contractual obligations and promises.
              Further suspensions occurred in 1819, 1837, 1839, and 1857.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Soon
              it was seen that the banking system was in total chaos. Something
              had to be done. Either banks had to honor their obligations and
              contracts, or a central bank was needed as a lender of last resort:
              the fall back guy that the state banks could rely on for credit,
              when the going got tough.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              honorable choice was the first option, but such was not to be,
              and the Second Bank of the United States was founded, in 1816.
              The Second Bank’s charter was fairly close to the First Bank’s:
              both were to issue paper currency redeemable in silver and gold,
              to purchase a large portion of the government debt, and to be the
              depository for Treasury funds.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">President
              Madison guided the Second Bank through Congress with the help of
              the rich Philadelphian lawyer and Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander
              J. Dallas, his close friend John Jacob Astor, and another rich
              Philadelphian lawyer by the name of Stephen Girard (reputed to
              be one of the two wealthiest men in America). The president of
              the bank was William Jones, a close friend to Dallas. This was
              the third public institution of the moneyed interests.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              Second Bank’s real expansion of power came under the presidency
              of Nicholas Biddle, another Philadelphian in the royal line of
              descent. Biddle headed the Bank from 1823 to the repeal of its
              charter in 1836, building it into the most powerful banking house
              in the country. After the repeal of the bank’s charter by President
              Jackson, Biddle continued to operate the bank under a Pennsylvania
              State charter for several years.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              alleged reason for another National Bank was to curtail the inflationary
              problems caused by excessive note issue, originally redeemable
              in gold and silver; but as we have seen, redemptions had been suspended,
              causing further depreciation in the purchasing power of paper currency.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">So
              what did the Second Bank of the United States do to stop the flood
              of paper money? Initially the bank was to raise $7 million in specie
              as reserves, it never acquired more than 2.5 million. In 1818,
              the Bank had 2.36 million in specie on reserve, and 21.8 million
              of notes and deposits on record. Within one and half years the
              bank had added 19.2 million to the Nation’s money supply; pyramiding
              at a ratio of 9.24 times reserves, which gave a reserve ratio of
              .11 – a mockery of inflation control and sound monetary policy.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Such
              a huge increase in the money supply caused a boom to occur – prices
              skyrocketed. The bank was in danger of not being able to honor
              redemptions in specie, so it had to contract the money supply.
              In one year (1818) the money supply decreased from 21.9 million
              to approximately $11.5 million – a reduction of 47%. Bankruptcies,
              defaults, and an overall bust of the economy resulted; a textbook
              example of the boom and bust cycles that paper money and fractional
              reserve lending can create. The only way to stop deflation is to
              prevent the inflation that leads to it.</font></p>

            JACKSON VERSUS THE BANKS</font></b></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              devastating effects of inflationary excesses followed by deflationary
              contractions, were two of the most compelling reasons behind Andrew
              Jackson’s battle against central banking. Several times throughout
              the 1830’s – 1850’s the country was shaken by similar events, the
              worst being the deflations of 1839 and 1857.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Jackson
              was an advocate for hard money, according to the constitutional
              system of honest weights and measures of silver and gold coin.
              He opposed the banks monopoly of the power to issue paper money
              based on the national debt. Jackson was against government intervention
              in the markets; and he believed in Thomas Jefferson’s laissez-faire
              philosophy of free markets and the right to private property.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">President
              Jackson methodically disestablished the Second Bank of the United
              States beginning in 1833 and ending in 1836, by removing the Treasury
              deposits from the bank and placing them in state banks. Nicholas
              Biddle didn’t give up easily, however, as he actually got the bank’s
              charter renewal passed through Congress: but Jackson remained undaunted – he
              vetoed the bill.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Biddle
              then used his crony Philadelphian associates to secure a Pennsylvanian
              State banking charter; and the Second Bank of the United States
              became the United States Bank of Pennsylvania, a commercial state
              enterprise. Even after the disestablishment of the Second Bank
              of the United States, the battle of the hard money Jacksonians
              raged on against the soft money interests; including Nicholas Biddle
              and his Philadelphian cohorts, but now the fight was on the State
              level.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Whenever
              the banks got into trouble, the government allowed them to suspend
              redemption of their bank notes in specie. This is one of the most
              destructive faults of a fractional reserve paper system – the moral
              hazard of not honoring one’s contractual obligations.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">But
              the greatest evil of fractional reserve banking is that bank reserves
              primarily consist of government bonds or the public debt; the base
              upon which the banks are allowed to pyramid notes and deposits – “bonding” for
              the Treasury Notes. The more government bonds the banks purchase,
              the more money it can create and issue, which means the greater
              the public debt – the greater is the supply of money. Monetization
              of public debt is synonymous with money creation: a pestilence
              sent by Typhus “that walketh the Earth in darkness.”</font></p>

            SUMMARY TO THE END OF CIVIL WAR</font></b></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Both
              the Constitution and the Original Coinage Act of 1792 defined and
              set the standard of our monetary system to be the unit of a dollar:
              a specific weight of silver that was exchangeable for a specific
              weight of gold. The emission of bills of credit or paper money
              was forbidden by the Constitution.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">However,
              this was all on the National level of Government, none of which
              applied to private banking; and there were plenty of private bankers
              ready and willing to issue a plethora of paper bank notes, and
              they did.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
              a letter to John Taylor in May of 1816, Thomas Jefferson stated:</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“The
              system of banking we have both equally and ever reprobated. I contemplate
              it as a blot<b><i> </i></b>left in all our constitutions, which,
              if not covered, will end in their destruction ... I sincerely believe,
              with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing
              armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by
              posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity
              on a large scale.&quot;</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Elsewhere
              Jefferson said:</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“I
              believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties
              than standing armies. Already they have raised up a money aristocracy
              that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power should
              be taken form the banks and restored to the government to whom
              it properly belongs.”</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">What
              was the “blot” left on our Constitution that Jefferson was referring
              to, which if not covered would end in its destruction? This is
              a question of the gravest importance, which should receive the
              undivided attention of our elected representatives, as our freedom
              and liberty hang in the balance.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              blot that Jefferson spoke of is exactly what we have seen: the
              legal crack in the Constitution that left the door wide open for
              the international bankers to gain access to our monetary system;
              and the resulting implementation of fractional reserve lending
              of paper bills of credit, their modis operandi; all precipitated
              by the inherent weakness of a bimetallic monetary currency, where
              one metal is set as the standard, and the exchange rate is fixed
              between the two metals, allowing Gresham’s Law to do the dirty
              work.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Once
              the culprits had squeezed through the door, they continued to expand
              their influence and dominance over the financial system. The first
              central banks grew in size and power, which was deftly wielded
              to persuade members of Congress to join the “ranks”.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Up
              until the Civil War and the legal tender Greenbacks, private banks
              had issued all paper currency, either by the First and Second Banks
              of the United States, or state banks. With the printing of the
              Greenbacks, banking entered a new era. Congress had failed to follow
              the constitutional disability not to issue paper bills of credit.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              United States went off of the specie redemption standard in 1861,
              and did not go back on it until the Resumption Act was officially
              implemented in 1879. During the years of 1819, 1837, 1839 and 1857,
              gold and silver redemption was also suspended.</font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Further
              suspensions would be forthcoming in the financial panics of 1884,
              1893, 1907, 1909, and 1921, with the final coup in 1934: Roosevelt’s
              Gold Reserve Act that outlawed private ownership of gold. Any allusion
              to a gold standard or any other metallic standard actually being
              contractually honored and practiced during these times is mere
              illusion and the stuff of fairy tales.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Only
              the banking business is allowed to dishonor or suspend their contractual
              obligations
              in this way. Any other type of business that operated in this unredeeming
              manner – would be investigated for allegedly committing fraud,
              extortion, and embezzlement, and most likely face legal prosecution.
              Greed knows no limits; the innermost recesses of the soul are not
              immune to its poisonous effects.</font> </P>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Although
              Greenbacks are believed to be the main source of financing for
              the Civil War,
              they were not – government bonds were. The total emission of Greenbacks
              was under $850 million, while Treasury Bonds were issued in the
              amount of almost $2 billion.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Jay
              Cooke and his brother Henry were close friends with Salmon Chase.
              The Cooke brothers
              supplied the money and backing that got Chase elected as Secretary
              of the Treasury. Henry owned one of the leading newspapers in Philadelphia,
              and he used it as a powerful forum to lobby for Chase. A letter
              from Cooke’s father stated that his sons planned to get Chase into
              the cabinet and Sherman into the Senate “to make money out of government
              contracts.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The new Secretary
              of the Treasury responded by granting Jay Cooke the exclusive authority
              to underwrite all government bonds. Cooke retained the coveted
              monopoly from 1862 to 1873, for all but one year; during which
              time he underwrote bonds totaling $2 billion. The competition of
              a free market is a wonder to behold, an enigma that baffles the
              most penetrating minds.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Visions
              of conquest inspired the brother’s next move. They convinced Senator
              Sherman to sponsor the National Currency Acts, which he readily
              pushed
              through Congress, creating the first national banking system.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#006699">NATIONAL
                  CURRENCY ACTS</font></b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Under the direction
              of Senator Sherman, Congress passed two National Currency Acts,
              one in 1863, another in 1864. The acts were intended to further
              the relationship between the government and the private banks,
              forming a symbiotic partnership capable of issuing a national paper
              currency.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">At first the national
              banks were allowed to issue notes up to 90% of the value of their
              government bond reserves. In 1900, the limit was raised to 100%.
              Cooke already controlled the selling of all bonds. By creating
              a national banking system to purchase them with, he and his cronies
              gained complete dominance of the market.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">A heavy tax was levied
              on state bank notes, causing them to essentially disappear. The
              Federal government now issued national banking charters. The National
              Currency Acts did not require national banks to redeem their notes
              in gold and silver. United States bonds provided the security,
              which meant that government debt was backing the currency. National
              bank notes were forced into use as the circulating currency, by
              declaring them to be legal tender for almost all payments to and
              from the government.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">A
              more profitable scheme would be hard to come by, but the elite
              collectivists would
              find yet other ways to turn their dreams of wealth into the people’s
              nightmares: of debt, taxation; bondage and servitude. A society
              divided into the haves – and the haves not, subjects to the whims
              of fortune.</font></p>

                AGAINST THE MONEY POWERS</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Andrew Jackson has
              been quoted as saying the following to a group of bankers as they
              approached him in the drawing room of the White House:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Gentlemen,
              I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced
              that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs
              of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you,
              and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that
              if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall
              ruin ten thousand families. That may be a true, gentleman, but
              that is your sin! Should I let you go on you will ruin fifty thousand
              families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and
              thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal
              God, I will rout you out!”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Who were the vipers
              and thieves Jackson was referring to? Were they the elite banking
              interests fighting for control of our monetary system? In 1862,
              while Senator Sherman was heading the Finance Committee, a most
              startling publication appeared: <i>The Hazard Circular of 1862</i>,
              which stated:&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Slavery
              is likely to be abolished by the war power and all chattel slavery
              abolished. This I and my European friends are in favor of, for
              slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care
              of the laborers, while the European plan, led on by England, is
              that capital shall control labor by controlling wages. The great
              debt that the capitalists will see to it is made out of the war,
              must be used as a means to control the volume of money. To accomplish
              this the bonds must be used as a banking basis. We are now waiting
              for the Secretary of the Treasury to make this recommendation to
              Congress. It will not do to allow the Greenback, as it is called,
              to circulate as money any length of time, as we cannot control
              that. But we can control the bonds and through them the bank issues.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Was
              it possible that Congress, although unknown to all but a select
              few elite, could
              pass legislation so similar to the above European plan to control
              America’s money? Recall the Coinage Act of 1878 that authorized
              the President to meet with foreign dignitaries to discuss an international<i> </i>monetary
              system; and the words of Senator Bate in regards to the Coinage
              Act of 1900: “It is the renewal and extension of the life of the
              bonds they are after, so that the national banks may flourish under
              existing laws.”&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">But many will dismiss <i>The
                Hazard Circular</i>, questioning its credibility and source of
                origin. Perhaps we should look to a more well-established and
                respected publication such as the <i>London Times,</i> which
                had the following to say:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“If
              that mischievous financial policy which had its origin in the North
              American Republic [i.e. honest Constitutionally authorized non
              debt money] should become indurated down to a fixture, then that
              government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay
              off its debts and be without a debt [to the international bankers].
              It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the
              civilized governments of the world. The brains and wealth of all
              countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed
              or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Taken
              together, the above statements provide a most revealing portrait
              of the elite
              money interests; and the sickness of a demented mind – itself deluded,
              while deluding others. Such disdain of freedom and liberty can
              only be equaled by their appalling view of world order. President
              Abraham Lincoln made a speech that was eerily similar to the above
              quoted Times article. It read as follows:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Yes,
              we may all congratulate ourselves that this cruel war is nearing
              its close. It has cost a vast amount of treasure and blood. The
              best blood of the flower of American youth has been freely offered
              upon our country's altar that the Nation might live. It has been,
              indeed a trying hour for the Republic; but I see in the future
              a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble
              for the safety of my country.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">As
              a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era
              of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of
              the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon
              the prejudices of the people until wealth is aggregated in a few
              hands and the Republic is destroyed. I feel at this moment more
              anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before, even in
              the midst of the war.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Considering
              the fact that one half of one percent of the world’s population own 95%
              of everything, Lincoln’s fears have proved to be well grounded – a
              prescient warning of things to come.</font></p>

              issued during peace, as opposed to the duress of war. Supportive
              of Honest Money was the dissenting opinion of Justice Fields, who

              that instrument intended to prohibit the issue of legal-tender
              notes both by the general government and by the states...” [110

              all know that the value of the notes of the government in the market,
              and in the commercial world generally, depends upon their convertibility
              on demand into coin; and as confidence in such convertibility increases
              of diminishes, so does the exchangeable value of the notes vary.
              So far from becoming themselves standards of value by reason of
              the legislative declaration to that effect, their own value is
              measured by the facility with which they can be exchanged into
              that which alone is regarded as money by the commercial world.
              They are promises of money, but they are not money in the sense

              beyond and above all the objections which I have stated to the
              decision recognizing a power in congress to impart the legal-tender
              quality to the notes of the government, is my objection to the
              rule of construction, adopted by the court to reach its conclusions — a
              rule which, fully carried out, would change the whole nature of
              our constitution, and break down the barriers which separate a
              government of limited from one of unlimited powers...The framers
              of<b> </b>the constitution, as I have said, were profoundly impressed
              with the evils which had resulted from the vicious legislation
              of the states making notes a legal tender, and they determined
              that such a power should not exist any longer. They therefore prohibited
              the states from exercising it, and they refused to grant it to
              the new government which they created. Of what purpose is it, then,
              to refer to the exercise of the power by the absolute or the limited
              governments of Europe, or by the states previous to out constitution?
              Congress can exercise no power by virtue of any supposed inherent
              sovereignty in the general government...The power to commit violence,
              perpetrate injustice, take private property by force without compensation
              to the owner, and compel the receipt of promises to pay in place
              of money, may be exercised, as it often has been, by irresponsible
              authority, but it cannot be considered as belonging to a government
              founded upon law. But be that as it may, there is no such thing
              as a power of inherent sovereignty in the government of the United
              States. It is a government of delegated powers, supreme within
              its prescribed sphere, but powerless outside of it. In this country,
              sovereignty resides in the people, and congress can exercise no
              power which they have not, by their constitution, intrusted to
              it; all else is withheld.” [110 U.S. 421 at 466-7]</font></p>

              If I have read the constitution aright...the true doctrine is the
              very opposite of this. If the power is not in terms granted, and
              is not necessary and proper for the exercise of a power which is

              Jackson had vetoed the renewal of the charter of the Bank of the
              United States,
              he was probably unaware that a few months earlier, in 1835, the
              House of Rothschild had signed an agreement with the United States
              Government, superseding the firm of Baring Brothers as the financial
              agent of the Department of State. Considering Jackson’s loathing
              of the money powers, any knowledge concerning such an agreement
              with the Rothschilds would have elicited his considerable wrath.
              The following is from the Rothschild’s Journal Records:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“The
              first established links between N. M. Rothschild and the United
              States date back to 1821 when the bankers <b><i>R. &amp; J. Phillips </i></b>in
              Philadelphia<i> </i>became agents for NMR business in the USA.
              Phillips were the first in a series of agents who were used to
              develop NMR's business interests in the country and correspondence
              from them can be found among the records of the Correspondence
              Department.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">From
              the Bank's accounts it is clear that by the end of the 1830s substantial
              and wide-ranging investments had been made in municipal and State
              stock, in canal and mining shares and in finance houses. The main
              activities carried on through the agents were in the fields of
              bullion and bills of exchange.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">In
              1833 NMR entrusted the New York banking house of <b><i>J. L. &amp; S.
              Josephs &amp; Co</i></b>. with the representation of its business
              interests in that city. The firm worked in conjunction with R. &amp; J.
              Phillips.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">In
              the following year, 1834, NMR succeeded in obtaining the business
              of undertaking the United States Government's<b><i> </i></b>banking
              interests in Europe<b><i>,</i></b> hitherto in the hands of Barings.
              The Rothschilds represented the <b><i>U. S. Government</i></b> until
              1843, when John Tyler became President and Barings' ally Daniel
              Webster was appointed Secretary of State. Webster promptly restored
              the accounts from Rothschilds to Barings.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">The
              disastrous New York banking crisis of 1837 saw the failure, along
              with many other banks, of the Rothschild’s New York agents J. L. &amp; S.
              Josephs. This coincided with the arrival in New York of <b><i>August
              Belmont</i></b>, a confidential clerk employed by the Frankfurt
              Rothschilds.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">Though
              on his way to Havana on behalf of the London and Paris Rothschilds,
              to investigate the affairs of the Spanish Government, on discovering
              the crisis in New York, Belmont turned his attention to sorting
              out Rothschild interests there. He quickly realized the potential
              of New York's growing economy and suggested that the Rothschilds
              appoint him as their agent in New<i> </i>York<i>.</i> The firm
              of <b><i>August Belmont &amp; Co</i></b><i>. </i>acted in this
              capacity until 1925.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">The
              discovery of gold in California in 1848 awakened NMR interest,
              given the Bank's substantial involvement in bullion trading. A <b><i>second </i></b>important
              Rothschild agency in the USA was rapidly established in San Francisco
              in 1849 by Benjamin Davidson and John May. The connection persisted
              until the impact of the gold rush had diminished. Letters from
              the American agents are mainly filed within the Correspondence
              Department.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">As
              far back as 1839, NMR had been involved in the business of raising
              finance for the U. S. Federal Government and its institutions.
              In that year, NMR, together with the Paris house of de Rothschild
              Frères, contracted for a <b><i>£900,000 </i></b>loan to the U.
              S. Bank.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">It
              was, however, in the 1870s that the Bank's involvement in this
              area was at its fullest. In 1872, NMR raised a $15 million bond
              issue for the City of New York to finance municipal improvements
              and in the following year, with Baring Brothers, raised a 5% funded
              loan for the US Government for a massive<i> <b>$300 million</b></i>.
              A loan of equal size was raised in 1876, this time in conjunction
              with J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. and Seligman Brothers and in 1877 a
              further<i> <b>$700 million</b></i><b>,</b> with these same partners,
              together with Rose &amp; Co.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">The
              last major issue raised on behalf of the Federal Government was
              for $62 million, in 1895, with J. S. Morgan. The scope of the records
              in the American Department is wider then the name suggests. Rothschilds’ non-European
              business interests, in Australia, Mexico, China and India, were
              dealt with by the American Department.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Most writers on this
              subject believe that the Rothschilds did not have much interest
              in American finance; yet we find them intricately involved in huge
              deals with the Philadelphian moneychangers, the New York and Wall
              Street financiers, and a West Coast connection as well. Perhaps
              compared to their all-encompassing dealings of global conquest,
              this was just a drop in the till.</font></p>

              there were steps being taken even now to bring him out of the financial
              backwaters – and they were not being taken by Pierpont Morgan himself.
              The first suggestion of his name for a role in the recharging of
              the reserve originated with the London branch of the House of Rothschild,

              1899, J.P. Morgan and Drexel went to England to attend the International

              Committee on Banking and Currency in the House have been made up
              chiefly of bankers, their agents, and their attorneys. ...In this
              way the committees have been able to control legislation in the

              means that war makes money for those who finance it. So who are

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Nelson Aldrich was
              financially well off when he left the wholesale grocery business.
              He then turned his attention to the political arena. Election to
              the United States Senate quickly followed. Within a few short years,
              Aldrich became a multi-millionaire of powerful influence. He was
              the father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, and his grandson, Nelson
              Aldrich Rockefeller, later became Vice President of the United
              States.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Plans for a central
              bank had been on the drawing board long before 1900. A complex
              task of such intricate detail required vast amounts of time and
              effort to construct; the work performed behind the scenes, out
              of the public view, waiting for the perfect moment to be unveiled.
              The sensitive demeanor of public opinion demanded that the subject
              be revealed in the most convincing and acceptable manner possible,
              avoiding all suspicion or doubt.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Charles
              A. Conant provided the initial groundwork for both a central bank
              and a gold
              exchange system. From 1902 to 1906, Conant was the treasurer of
              the Morgan controlled Morton Trust Company of New York. He also
              worked for the Federal government as one of the three members of
              Roosevelt’s Commission On International Exchange, and for Brown
              Brothers Harriman. Conant was the guiding hand behind Mexico’s,
              Panama’s, and the Philippine’s change from a silver standard to
              a gold exchange system. China and Cuba were his only failures to
              convert to a gold standard.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In 1900, the United
              States, Britain, and Japan intervened in the Boxer Rebellion in
              China. After hostilities had ended, China was ordered to pay war
              reparations of $300 million. The United States demanded payment
              in gold. At the time, China was on a depreciated silver standard
              and wanted to pay in silver. Fortunately, the Chinese had centuries
              of experience in monetary affairs, and had learned their lessons
              well. They knew a ruse when they saw one, refusing to pay in gold.
              Silver was finally accepted.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Why did the elite
              money powers push Roosevelt, as well as the rest of the world,
              away from a silver standard, towards a gold standard? Might it
              be for the same reasons we have seen our own monetary system flip
              back and forth from silver to gold?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Our history provides
              clear evidence that first one metal was over-valued and then the
              other, creating imbalances in the price structure that could be
              manipulated in the domestic home market, and then sold abroad in
              a foreign market, where the rate of exchange was completely different.
              Gold and silver coins were driven out of circulation several times
              by the money powers employing these tactics.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Such
              adjustments in foreign exchange are one of the international banker’s favorite
              mechanisms to redistribute the wealth of the Nations – the wealth
              of “We The People”. Often appearing to be surreal, in the fullness
              of its absurdity – it is, in reality, the very real life game the
              rulers of the universe live by; and suffer upon the people.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Perhaps
              this explains the oversight in our bimetallic exchange system,
              where the price
              of silver had been fixed as the standard, but the price of gold
              was allowed to float, providing the means for manipulation and
              redistribution. Perhaps this explains Jefferson’s “blot”. The evidence
              has been presented; justice will decide the verdict.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">And
              this was only the beginning of their wealth transference scheme.
              More cards remained
              hidden, waiting to be played: the Federal Reserve Act of 1913;
              the 1922 Genoa Gold Exchange Accord; Roosevelt’s infamous Gold
              Reserve Act of 1934; the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement that declared
              the U.S. Dollar to be the reserve currency of the world; the 1944
              creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the General
              Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) and the World Bank (WB) – all
              to promote a new socialistic world order, by slowly but methodically
              eliminating gold from world finance; Nixon’s closing of the Gold
              Window in 1971, which basically amounted to a national declaration
              of bankruptcy from the United States; and many more acts too numerous
              to list.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In
              1911 the following excerpt appeared in McClure’s Magazine:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Seven
              men in Wall Street now control a great share of the fundamental
              industry and resources of the United States. Three of the seven
              men, J.P. Morgan, James J. Hill, and George F. Baker, head of the
              First National Bank of New York belong to the so-called Morgan
              group; four of them, John D. and William Rockefeller, James Stillman,
              head of the National City Bank, and Jacob H. Schiff of the private
              banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb Company, to the so-called Standard Oil
              City Bank group... the central machine of capital extends its control
              over the United States... The process is not only economically
              logical; it is now practically automatic.”</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">In 1906, Jacob H.
              Shiff, who was the head of the prestigious banking firm of Kuhn,
              Loeb and Company, gave a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce.
              His main goal was to stress the urgent need of an elastic currency,
              issued by a national bank system.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Nonetheless,
              it was Shiff’s partner at Kuhn, Loeb and Company, Paul M. Warburg, who
              had planted the seed for a central bank. Schiff and Warburg were
              elite international bankers from Germany, and both had years of
              experience with the Central Bank of Germany – the Reichsbank. The
              time was fast approaching for the fruit to bare witness to the
              nature of the seed.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">George
              Sylvester Viereck’s
              book “<i>The Strangest Friendship in History</i>” is about the
              most unusual relationship between Woodrow Wilson and Colonel Mandell
              House. Although a private citizen, the Colonel often stayed at
              The White House, privileged with unlimited access to President
              Wilson, for whom he unofficially functioned as chief advisor. The
              following quote sums up a very strange friendship indeed:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“The
              Schiffs, the Warburgs, the Kahns, the Rockefellers, the Morgans
              put their faith in House. When the Federal Reserve legislation
              at last assumed definite shape, House was the intermediary between
              the White House and the financiers.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The banking crisis
              of 1907 added fuel to the fire for a central bank. During the panic,
              the banks were once again allowed to suspend redemption of bank
              notes in specie. There was widespread talk and discussion on the
              need of a central bank to provide support to the banking system,
              especially during financial panics, as had just occurred.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Congressman
              Charles Lindbergh, who spent most of his life fighting against
              the “money
              trust”, had the following to say while testifying before the Committee
              on Rules (191l):</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“The
              Aldrich Plan is the Wall Street Plan. It is a broad challenge to
              the Government by the champion of the Money Trust. It means another
              panic, if necessary, to intimidate the people. Aldrich, paid by
              the Government to represent the people, proposes a plan for the
              trusts instead. It was by a very clever move that the National
              Monetary Commission was created. In 1907 nature responded most
              beautifully and gave this country the most bountiful crop it had
              ever had. Other industries were busy too, and from a natural standpoint
              all the conditions were right for a most prosperous year. Instead,
              a panic entailed enormous losses upon us. Wall Street knew the
              American people were demanding a remedy against the recurrence
              of such a ridiculously unnatural condition. Most Senators and Representatives
              fell into the Wall Street trap and passed the Aldrich Vreeland
              Emergency Currency Bill. But the real purpose was to get a monetary
              commission which would frame a proposition for amendments to our
              currency and banking laws, which would suit the Money Trust. The
              interests are now busy everywhere educating the people in favor
              of the Aldrich Plan. It is reported that a large sum of money has
              been raised for this purpose. Wall Street speculation brought on
              the Panic of 1907. The depositors' funds were loaned to gamblers
              and anybody the Money Trust wanted to favor. Then when the depositors
              wanted their money, the banks did not have it. That made the panic.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Senator Nelson Aldrich
              pushed the Aldrich-Vreeland Act through Congress in 1908. The main
              purpose of the bill was to establish a National Monetary Commission
              to study the prospects of national banking reform, including a
              central bank and an elastic money supply.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS">In
              1910, Senator Aldrich organized the infamous meeting at Jekyll
              Island – to
                construct a plan for a central banking system. The system was
                introduced as the Aldrich Plan to Congress in 1912. Surprisingly,
                the bill was defeated. Woodrow Wilson was elected as the Democratic
                President that same year. Bertie
                Charles Forbes was a financial writer at the time – he later
                founded Forbes Magazine. He wrote the following article about
                the Jekyll Island meeting:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Picture
              a party of the nation's greatest bankers stealing out of New York
              on a private railroad car under cover of darkness, stealthily riding
              hundred of miles South, embarking on a mysterious launch, sneaking
              onto an island deserted by all but a few servants, living there
              a full week under such rigid secrecy that the names of not one
              of them was once mentioned lest the servants learn the identity
              and disclose to the world this strangest, most secret expedition
              in the history of American finance. I am not romancing; I am giving
              to the world, for the first time, the real story of how the famous
              Aldrich currency report, the foundation of our new currency system,
              was written . . . The utmost secrecy was enjoined upon all. The
              public must not glean a hint of what was to be done. Senator Aldrich
              notified each one to go quietly into a private car of which the
              railroad had received orders to draw up on an unfrequented platform.
              Off the party set. New York's ubiquitous reporters had been foiled
              . . . Nelson (Aldrich) had confided to Henry (P. Davison, senior
              partner of J.P. Morgan Company), Frank (Vanderlip, president of
              the National City Bank of New York), Paul (Warburg) and A. Piatt
              (Andrew, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Special Assistant
              of the National Monetary Commission) that he was to keep them locked
              up at Jekyll Island, out of the rest of the world, until they had
              evolved and compiled a scientific currency system for the United
              States, the real birth of the present Federal Reserve System, the
              plan done on Jekyll Island in the conference with Paul, Frank and
              Henry . . . Warburg is the link that binds the Aldrich system and
              the present system together. He more than any one man has made
              the system possible as a working reality.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Not
              mentioned by Forbes was Charles D. Norton, president of J.P. Morgan’s First National
              Bank of New York, and Benjamin Strong, head of J.P. Morgan’s Trust
              Company. Frank Vanderlip later wrote in his autobiography, “<i>From
              Farmboy to Financier</i>”:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Our
              secret expedition to Jekyll Island was the occasion of the actual
              conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.
              The essential points of the Aldrich Plan were all contained in
              the Federal Reserve Act as it was passed.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              change from Republican to Democratic control of the White House,
              affected the Aldrich
              Plan, as Aldrich was a Republican. Now the plan had to be sold
              to the Democrats. The elite international bankers called upon Senator
              Carter Glass to lend his influence and guiding hand. Making very
              little changes in the actual context of the Aldrich Plan, aside
              from removing Aldrich’s name from the plan, Glass introduced and
              passed the Federal Reserve Act in December of 1913. The following
              news clip on Senator Aldrich, appeared in Harpers Weekly:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“Finance
              and the tariff are reserved by Nelson Aldrich as falling within
              his sole purview and jurisdiction. Mr. Aldrich is endeavoring to
              devise, through the National Monetary Commission, a banking and
              currency law. A great many hundred thousand persons are firmly
              of the opinion that Mr. Aldrich sums up in his personality the
              greatest and most sinister menace to the popular welfare of the
              United States. Ernest Newman recently said, 'What the South visits
              on the Negro in a political way, Aldrich would mete out to the
              mudsills of the North, if he could devise a safe and practical
              way to accomplish it.&quot;</font></p>

            THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">On December 22 the
              Federal Reserve Act was passed. President Wilson signed the bill
              on Christmas Eve, the 24<sup>th</sup> of December 1913. The New
              York Times carried a front-page article that stated “Prosperity
              To Be Free”. Congressman Lindbergh had a somewhat different view:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“This
              Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President
              signs this bill, the invisible government by the Monetary Power
              will be legalized. The people may not know it immediately, but
              the day of reckoning is only a few years removed. The trusts will
              soon realize that they have gone too far even for their own good.
              The people must make a declaration of independence to relieve themselves
              from the Monetary Power. This they will be able to do by taking
              control of Congress. Wall Streeters could not cheat us if you Senators
              and Representatives did not make a humbug of Congress. . . If we
              had a people's Congress, there would be stability. The greatest
              crime of Congress is its currency system. The worst legislative
              crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking bill. The caucus
              and the party bosses have again operated and prevented the people
              from getting the benefit of their own government.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Often it is asked,
              what is the purpose of the Federal Reserve. The original act states:</font></p>

              Perhaps the article that W.H. Allen wrote in Moody’s Magazine,
              in 1916 had a clearer perspective:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">“The
              purpose of the Federal Reserve Act was to prevent concentration
              of money in the New York banks by making it profitable for country
              bankers to use their funds at home, but the movement of currency
              shows that the New York banks gained from the interior in every
              month except December, 1915, since the Act went into effect. The
              stabilization of rates has taken place in New York alone. In other
              parts, high rates continue. The Act, which was to deprive Wall
              Street of its funds for speculation, has really given the bulls
              and the bears such a supply, as they have never had before. The
              truth is that far from having clogged the channel to Wall Street,
              as Mr. Glass so confidently boasted, it actually widened the old
              channels and opened up two new ones. The first of these leads directly
              to Washington and gives Wall Street a string on all the surplus
              cash in the United States Treasury. Besides, in the power to issue
              bank-note currency, it furnishes an inexhaustible supply of credit
              money; the second channel leads to the great central banks of Europe,
              whereby, through the sale of acceptances, virtually guaranteed
              by the United States Government, Wall Street is granted immunity
              from foreign demands for gold which have precipitated every great
              crisis in our history.”</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Others
              have written on the creation of the Federal Reserve and the monetary
              history
              that followed. We will save examining such history in detail for
              a future work. Suffice it to say that the Genoa Accord, Roosevelt’s
              Gold Reserve Act, as well as the Bretton Woods Agreement and Nixon’s
              closing of the gold window – were not any more honest then the
              earlier gold standards we have examined. If anything, the latter
              monetary history is more blatantly dishonest and unsound then what
              had come before.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Such
              history lends credence to the view that our monetary policy has
              not evolved,
              but has instead – devolved. Our present Federal Reserve Notes have
              become little more than a revolving tax payment voucher, and even
              that may be too kind. Present Federal Reserve Notes are according
              to the U.S. Code “redeemable in lawful money”; which implies that
              our currency is not lawful money, otherwise why would or how could
              it be, redeemed in lawful money, if it were such to begin with?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Federal
              Reserve Notes function as the ultimate wealth transference mechanism.
              When paper
              obligations of government debt are allowed to circulate as legal
              tender, the resulting debasement of the currency and loss of purchasing
              power siphons wealth away from “We The People” who hold and owe
              the debt, towards the elite few who issue the debt. The tail is
              wagging the dog.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Even
              the Federal Reserve admits that the dollar has lost 95% of its
              purchasing power since
              1913, the year it took control – a most infamous distinction for
              a central banker’s resume. Within 20 years of the Fed’s creation,
              our economy experienced the most severe financial crisis in history.
              Neither event seems to be in keeping with its stated purpose: “to
              establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United
              States.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Many
              believe the Federal Reserve banks are government institutions – they are not. They
              are private credit monopolies that prey upon the people for the
              benefit of themselves and their greedy handlers: the international
              moneychangers. These are the same global money powers that hire
              lobbyists to garnish votes to control our legislation – for their
              own special interests; and who maintain international propaganda
              machines for the purpose of deceiving us into granting new concessions
              that permit them to cover up their past misdeeds, and to set again
              in motion the gigantic wheels of wealth transference and bonded
              debt – the feudal yoke of bondage and servitude.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Many
              are of the opinion that a return to the gold standard is the best
              answer for the urgently
              needed reform of our monetary system. As we have seen, however,
              the gold standard was not what many believe it to be. Gold was
              not the original constitutional standard – silver was.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              so-called failure of the gold and silver standards is not a reflection
              on either
              silver or gold. The would be masters of the universe have gone
              to great lengths to discredit and dishonor both metals, by purposefully
              entangling them within a finely spun web of self-destructive standards
              and systems, knowingly doomed to fail from the start. All by careful
              design to attain the final goal: the removal of gold and silver
              from the world’s monetary system. Nothing was left to chance, just
              in case it exists.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Without
              gold to keep the creatures at bay, the elite moneychangers have
              free reign to
              force their debt-ridden system of paper fiat upon the people. The
              International Monetary Fund’s Articles of Agreement, Section 4-2b,
              states that no member country can have a currency backed by gold.
              Yet until about a year ago, the Bank For International Settlements
              (BIS), which is the central banks central bank, only accepted settlement
              from each other in gold. They would not accept one another’s paper
              currency. Recently they’ve changed to special drawing rights (SDR’s):
              vouchers that represent a basket of paper currencies – paper promises
              for a basket of other paper promises.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Several
              well-intentioned writers have suggested that $3000 dollar an ounce
              gold represents
              the requisite price needed to re-establish a gold backing to our
              current paper money. It is this writer’s opinion that such would
              not represent a return to Honest Money. It would moreover, be as
              ill conceived as trying to give Sodom and Gomorrah an honorable
              name. The present United States Dollar Bill or Federal Reserve
              Note is not worthy of being backed by gold. Federal Reserve Notes
              are “a heritage of reproach” – the antithesis of Honest Money.</font></p>

              of whether or not it is backed by gold, is not<b> </b>the original

              of silver and gold coin is Honest Money. Paper fiat is simply a
              mechanism of wealth transference, where wealth is siphoned off
              from “We The People” by the debasement of the currency through
              inflation and loss of purchasing power. This is a system of wealth
              redistribution that enables <b>one half of one percent</b><i> </i>of

              Paper money that is fractionally backed by specie creates debt
              for the many and wealth for the few. Fractional reserve lending
              is a scourge to mankind that would be best put to rest.</font></p>

              of gold being used to back Federal Reserve Notes, while at the

              per ounce, is not only unconstitutional, it would also help perpetuate
              the grand illusion the international bankers would have us believe.
              Our original constitutional money was not priced or denominated
              in Federal Reserve Notes or in dollar bills, and there has not
              been a constitutional amendment to change it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Dollar bills or Federal
              Reserve Notes did not set the standard, definition or value of
              money. Silver was the standard by which the dollar was defined,
              according to Honest Weights and Measures; and both gold and silver <b>coin</b> exchanged
              as the currency of Honest Money. The dollar was defined by specific <b>weights </b>of
              silver and gold, <b>not</b> vice versa. And a dollar bill is a
              piece of paper, a Federal Reserve Note, while a dollar is a specific
              weight of silver coin: 371.25 grains of silver. So a dollar bill
              and a dollar are two different things. Who would have guessed?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">To define or price
              either gold or silver in terms of dollars, especially Federal Reserve
              Notes, is to turn the original system of our money upside down.
              Such a system has already been had and weighed in the balance and
              found to be wanting. This is the <b>great lie<i> </i></b>or myth

              commonly referred to as a silver dollar: 371.25 grains of silver – into
              paper Federal Reserve Notes or dollar bills. At first the moneychangers
              backed the dollar with fractional amounts of silver and gold, slowly
              reducing the amount over time, until the final coup d’etat: the

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">There
              is a system of Honest Weights and Measures, that can and will work – but it
              cannot, and must not, allow for the issuance of paper money or
              bills of credit, whereby government debt is monetized – meaning
              that the debt circulates as the currency or money.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Our
              existing monetary system allows money, credit and debt to morph
              into one and the
              same entity. There is no honesty in such a system, only empty promises
              to exchange for future empty promises. There is no payment, only
              promises to pay. The future is being sold, by the extension of
              credit and the acceptance of debt, to obtain in the present that
              which cannot be paid for here and now. We are being sold out and
              hoodwinked, accepting the unacceptable: the prostitution of our
              children and their children’s future, which will be spent working
              to pay off the debt we are accumulating.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">A strange brew has
              been cast into fortunes cauldron: shadows of politics and finance,
              the gnashing teeth of greed and lust, the gnawing torments of the
              quest for power; all stirred by the currents of the past, as they
              ripple across the present, forming the future that lies ahead.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The rulers no longer
              allow for a monetary policy where both the everyday expenses of
              government, and the extraordinary costs of war, are financed by
              the age-old method of raising money by the levying of taxes within
              that year. The resulting increase of expenditures would cause too
              great a rise in yearly taxes, which has never been acceptable to
              the People, and thus a political coup de grace, for those seeking
              the future holding of public office.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Instead,
              a new system was created – based on <b>future </b>tax revenues of the State.
              The prospective sum total of receipts was used as the base upon
              which to borrow large sums of money, by the issuing of bonded debt;
              thus allowing for only a slight increase in taxes, enough to pay
              for the service on the outstanding debt; or better yet, no increase
              at all. This created the elite international moneychangers dream:
              the grand illusion of ever-expanding debt and a perpetual interest

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Has
              all this stuff been paid for, or has it been “leased” – even if for an entire
              lifetime, by the extension of credit and the acceptance of debt?
              Does he who owes the debt own the property, or does the banker
              who has extended the credit – who holds the title, own it? And

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Where

              obligations, to whom taxes are owed; both directly as property
              tax or income tax, or tariffs, etc., and indirectly as occurs through
              the debasement and inflation of the currency, which although unseen,
              is a tax of deadly stealth. Over the long-term it does more damage
              to one’s purchasing power, and hence wealth, then any of the up-front

              creditor’s property
              exists in the demand he has upon the debtor, yet the debtor is
              but a trustee to the creditor for a portion of the value of his
              income and or private property, needed to pay his portion of the
              public debt, by taxes. The creditor becomes richer; by the amount
              the nation becomes poorer, in paying the taxes. This only condemns
              our future sons and daughter to a life of perpetual servitude and
              debt. It is a vicious circle of chasing one’s tail.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The
              final step in the master’s plan was to create a currency that was connected to
              bonded debt at the hip, as Siamese twins, essentially using private
              property, the People’s possessions, land and labor, to provide
              the necessary income to pay the required taxes, to service the
              public debt. This is not freedom – this is nothing but a hidden
              system of bondage and indebtedness, to enrich the elite few at
              the cost of the many: feudalism of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</font></p>

              harder than the rest of us? Are they smarter than the rest of us?
              Are they superior to the rest of us? Then how did they come by

              is the true cause
              of all the United State’s financial problems, including the current
              account deficit, which has now become 5.7% of our gross domestic
              product. One of the results of this astounding deficit is the fact
              that our country has gone from being the largest creditor nation

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">This is clearly evident

              which is what the United States owes to the rest of the world;
              the difference between the value of all United States assets outside
              of our country in foreign nations, minus the amount of United States

              12 trillion dollars, so the United States foreign investment position
              of approximately minus 3 trillion dollars is equivalent to almost <b>25%</b> of

              of gold and
              silver, not a return to a system of paper money that is backed
              by gold and silver. If gold and silver are valuable enough to back
              the currency, then they are the real deal – the true value. Why
              not use them as the currency? Is someone afraid of gold and silver
              being the currency? Why?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The policy of fractional
              reserve lending allows banks to essentially lend that which they
              do not have. This is why banks may be solvent, but they are not
              liquid. Such a system allows for the moral hazard of not honoring
              contractual obligations. If half of the People went to the banks
              and demanded to withdraw their money, do the banks have the money?
              No other business besides banking is allowed to work according
              to such rules.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">A
              fractional reserve system of money cannot be liquid; it is impossible.
              If more depositors
              demand to redeem more money then the banks have on reserve, huge
              problems can occur. Such is what precipitates bank runs, deflation,
              depressions, or worse yet – hyperinflation and the total destruction
              of the currency. History is replete with such events.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Existing Federal Reserve
              Notes must be realized as what they are: future goods being exchanged
              for present goods. Most are of the opinion that bank notes are
              present goods. But how can that be? Even when backed by gold they
              were future goods.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">The Constitution states
              that nothing but silver and gold are money, and that paper bills
              of credit are not allowed. What is a Federal Reserve Note, if not
              a bill of credit, a receipt that at one time could be redeemed
              in gold and silver? Now they are redeemable in lawful money, although
              no one seems to know exactly what that is.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">If a bank note is
              an obligation to be redeemed, it is an obligation that has not
              been paid. It is an obligation that has yet to be fulfilled; hence
              it is a future good, waiting to be fulfilled. When one uses bank
              notes they are exchanging a future good (the bank note) for a present
              good (the item they exchange it for).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Because
              of the time preference of a future good to a present good, such
              a transaction
              involves the extension of credit, as a promise to fulfill a contract
              or obligation is being offered and accepted. The transaction, however,
              has not been completed – payment has not yet been made. Goods have
              been exchanged on credit – they have not yet been paid for, but
              simply discharged or offset.</font></p>

              prosperous; if not, we starve. We are absolutely without a permanent
              money system. When one gets a complete grasp of the picture, the
              tragic absurdity of our hopeless position is almost incredible,
              but there it is. It is the most important subject intelligent persons
              can investigate and reflect upon. It is so important that our present

              does not grant the power to Congress to be in the banking business,
              functioning as a bank of deposit. Congress was granted the power
              to <b>borrow</b> money, <b>not </b>to <b>loan</b> it out. Our monetary
              system should create <b>wealth</b> – not <b>debt.</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Furthermore, we have
              seen that the banks and the government can easily declare national
              emergencies, enacting The War Powers Act or The Trading With The
              Enemy Act<i>,</i> thereby obtaining reasons for suspending specie
              redemption; or worse – the private ownership of gold can be declared
              illegal and the currency called in; which is a good reason for
              the People to demand a constitutional amendment explicitly disallowing
              such legislative or executive powers, just in case such do exist.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">President Jackson
              well understood the vast power and influence the banking powers
              could wield, this is why he stated in an address to Congress, in
              1829:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3"><span style=" color: navy">&quot;The
                bold efforts that the present bank has made to <b>control the
                government</b> and the distress it has wantonly caused, are but
                premonitions of the fate which awaits the American people should
                they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the
                establishment of another like it...If the people only understood
                the rank injustice of our money and banking system there would
                be a revolution before morning.&quot;</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Look
              closely at a newly minted United States Gold Eagle Coin. On the
              backside of
              the coin, at the bottom, is stamped: 1 OZ FINE GOLD – 50 DOLLARS.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Why does a one ounce
              gold coin, that is presently trading in the market for approximately
              $450, have stamped on it $50? And yet the gold the government holds
              is valued on the books at $42.22 an ounce. Why all the discrepancies?
              Try that with your bookkeeping and see what happens.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Part
              of the answer goes back to the legal tender issue. The government
              has stamped
              the one ounce gold coin to have the legal tender value of $50,
              but the market price of one ounce of gold is almost 9 times greater.
              This disparity is the exact reason why even gold and silver coin
              should not have a dollar amount fixed on it, but simply have stamped
              Honest Weights and Measures of gold and silver content – as in
              a one ounce coin, a half ounce coin, a quarter ounce coin, a tenth
              ounce coin, etc.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">Even
              a true dualmetallic system of gold and silver coin, leaves many
              problems to be solved,
              but at least it is a step in the right direction, and, a journey
              of a thousand miles does begin with one step. And if ever a step
              in the right direction was needed, now is the time – as the numerous
              coinage acts that followed the original Act of 1792, have presently
              placed the United State’s monetary system on self-destruct – heading
              down the Sisphusian slope of collective, corporate, socialistic,
              global, and perhaps even fascist control.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3">If gold and silver
              are good enough to back the currency, then they are good enough

              Sovereigns to its rightful place – as Honest Money. We do not need
              to back the dollar with gold. Simply open the mint to the free
              coinage of gold and silver coin. Let gold and silver be accepted
              for all payments, at free market rates of exchange; and circulate
              along with Federal Reserve Notes. Let the People decide which they
              prefer to use. And maybe Christmas will come early; and all the
              gold that was confiscated from the People will be returned to the

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">&quot;But
              when the charter for the bank of the United States was obtained
              from Congress, it perfected the paper system, and gave to its advocates
              the position they have struggled to obtain from the commencement
              of the Federal Government down to the present hour. The immense
              capital and peculiar privileges bestowed upon it enabled it to
              exercise despotic sway over the other banks in every part of the
              country. From its superior strength it could seriously injure,
              if not destroy, the business of any one of them that would incur
              its resentment; and it openly claimed for itself the power of regulating
              the currency throughout the United States. In other words, it asserted
              (and undoubtedly possessed) the power to make money plenty or scarce,
              at its pleasure, at any time, and in any quarter of the Union,
              by controlling the issues of other banks, and in permitting an
              expansion, or compelling a general contraction of the circulating
              medium according to its own will.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">The
              other banking institutions were sensible of its strength, and they
              soon became generally its obedient instruments, ready at all times
              to execute its mandates; and with the other banks necessarily went
              also that numerous class of persons in our commercial cities who
              depend altogether on bank credits for their solvency and means
              of business, and who are therefore obliged, for their safety, to
              propitiate the favor of the money power by distinguished zeal and
              devotion in its service. The result of the ill-advised legislation
              which established this great monopoly, was to concentrate the whole
              moneyed power of the Union, with its boundless means of corruption,
              and its numerous dependents, under the direction and command of
              one acknowledged head; thus organizing this particular interest
              as one body, and securing to it unity of action throughout the
              United States, and enabling it to bring forward, upon any occasion,
              its entire and undivided strength to support or defeat any measure
              of the government. In the hands of this formidable power, thus
              perfectly organized, was also placed unlimited dominion over the
              amount of circulating medium, giving it the power to regulate the
              value of property, and the fruits of labor in every quarter of
              the Union; and to bestow prosperity, or bring ruin upon any city
              or section of the country as might best comport with its own interests
              or policy.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Trebuchet MS" size="3" color="#000080">We
              are not left to conjecture how the moneyed power, thus organized,
              and with such a weapon in its hands, would be likely to use it.
              The distress and alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country,
              when the Bank of the United States waged war upon the people in
              order to compel them to submit to their demands, cannot yet be
              forgotten. The ruthless and unsparing temper with which whole cities
              and communities were oppressed, individuals impoverished and ruined,
              a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly changed into one of gloom
              and despondency, ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory
              of the people of the United States. If such were its power in a
              time of peace, what would it not have been in a season of war,
              with an enemy at your doors? No nation but the freeman of the United
              States could have come out victorious from such contest; yet, if
              you had not conquered, the Government would have passed from the
              hands of the many to the hands of the few; and this organized money
              power, from its secret conclave, would have dictated the choice
              of your highest officers, and compelled you to make peace or war,
              as best suited their own wishes. The form of your Government might
              for a time have remained, but its living spirit would have departed
              from it.&quot;</font></p>

                <h1>The History of American Money</h1>
            </header>
    <p>During the Revolutionary War, two things almost led to the defeat of the struggle for American independence. One was the inadequate system of constitutional government, and the other was unsound money.</p>
<p>Congress issued about $240 million in &#8220;Continentals&#8221;&#8211;referring to money of the Continental Congress. It was understood that the money would be redeemed in gold or silver by the states after the war.</p>
<p>The states thought this was a great way to manufacture money so they issued vast quantities of their own paper currency.</p>
<p>The British saw what was happening, so they printed up bales of counterfeit &#8220;Continentals&#8221; and used them to buy supplies from Americans.</p>
<blockquote style="width: 200px; float: right; text-align: center;"><p><strong>Probably no aspect of the American economy has strayed further from the Constitution than the monetary system. </strong></p>
<p>&#8211;W. Cleon Skousen, The Making of America, p. 419</p></blockquote>
<p>Before long, confidence in the Continentals had sunk so low that by 1780 they were not even worth one cent. No further paper money was issued by the United States for over eighty years.</p>
<p>The American market had already accepted the Spanish dollar as its basic unit of value. It was minted in Mexico and called a &#8220;piece of eight,&#8221; or a peso. The words Spanish peso are said to have been abbreviated into an S and a P with one written over the other. This was further abbreviated to a &#8220;$&#8221; sign.</p>
<p>The word dollar originally came from a Bohemian word thal, meaning &#8220;valley.&#8221; A silver coin was minted in a certain Bohemian valley and became known as a &#8220;thaler,&#8221; which was transliterated into English as a &#8220;dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1700s, the Spanish came out with a silver coin of almost exactly the same size and weight as a thaler. It represented eight Spanish gold &#8220;reals&#8221; and was therefore called a &#8220;piece of eight.&#8221; In the marketplace merchants referred to this as the &#8220;Spanish dollar.&#8221; However, to make change, they would cut a dollar into eight pieces or &#8220;bits.&#8221; These began to be called two bits for a quarter, four bits for fifty cents, and six bits for seventy-five cents.</p>
<p>In 1785, two years before the Constitution was written, the Congress accepted the Spanish dollar as the official unit of value for the United States and determined that all foreign coin would be evaluated in terms of the Spanish dollar.</p>
<p>In 1786, the year before the Constitution was adopted, the Board of Treasury fixed the silver weight of the adopted dollar at 375 and 64/100s grains of fine silver. The value of gold coins or any other coins was to be calculated in terms of the silver dollar of this weight and fineness.</p>
<p>It will be noted that three things had been established before the Constitution was adopted:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>That the official money of the United States would be precious metals&#8211;silver and gold.</li>
<li>That the basic unit of value would be called a &#8220;dollar&#8221; and consist of 375 and 64/100s grains of fine silver.</li>
<li>All other coins, both foreign and domestic, would be evaluated in terms of this official silver dollar.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this was already part of the law of the land when the Constitution was adopted. Therefore, the Founders wrote the following provisions in the Constitution concerning money based on the above statutes which had previously been adopted as the official monetary system.</p>
<p>They wrote:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Congress shall have the power &#8220;to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures.&#8221; (Article I, section 8, clause 5.)</li>
<li>Congress shall have the power to punish the counterfeiting of money. (Article I, section 8, clause 6.)</li>
<li>No tax on imported persons (bonded servants) shall exceed ten dollars. Note the reference to &#8220;dollars&#8221; in this provision.(Article I, section 9, clause 1.)</li>
<li>No state shall coin money, emit bills of credit, or make anything but gold and silver tender in payment of debts. (Article 1, section 10, clause 1.)</li>
<li>In civil cases for more than twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. (Seventh Amendment.)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1792, the Coinage Act was passed. It invoked the death penalty for anyone debasing the money. It provided for a United States mint where silver dollars were coined along with gold coins beginning in 1794. Altogether nearly 900,000,000 silver dollars were coined from that time until 1935 when the treasury stopped minting them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Silver dollars contained 46 grains of standard silver similar to the Spanish dollar, which had now been determined to be 371.25 grains of fine silver.</li>
<li>Half dollars, quarters, and dimes and &#8220;half dimes&#8221; contained a proportionate amount of silver.</li>
<li>Pennies and half pennies were made of copper.</li>
<li>Gold eagles were worth ten silver dollars, with a ratio between gold and silver fixed by statute. The fixing of this ratio by statute turned out to be a mistake. Each metal should have been allowed to follow its independent market value.</li>
<li>Half eagles (worth $5) and quarter eagles (worth $2.50) were also minted.</li>
<li>Free minting privileges were granted to all citizens. They could take either gold or silver to the mint and have it minted into coins. This practice lasted until 1873.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ratio between gold and silver which was fixed by statute at 15 to 1 was soon out of phase in favor of gold. As a result, much of the American gold stocks began to be purchased by Europe.</p>
<p>In 1834, the ratio was changed to 16 to 1which favored silver, and from then until the Civil War the nation was, for all practical purposes, on a gold standard. Europe began buying silver, with the gold it had previously accumulated. This soon brought gold stocks back to the United States.</p>
<h2>Paper Currency</h2>
<p>We have already noted that there are two kinds of paper currency which are not &#8220;money&#8221; but circulate as such: the first is debt money, which can be redeemed in silver and gold on demand, and the other is <em>fiat</em> (paper) money, which is designated as legal tender but cannot be redeemed for anything.</p>
<p>As indicated earlier, the original draft of the Constitution authorized Congress to &#8220;emit bills of credit.&#8221; This had reference to debt money or currency which would be redeemed with gold or silver. After an extensive discussion the Founders decided they couldn&#8217;t risk it. There would be no United States debt currency or bills of credit. As for <em>fiat</em> money, this was so abhorrent to the Founders they didn&#8217;t even discuss it.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Founders knew that people do not like to conduct business&#8211;except for minor transactions&#8211;with precious metal. Metal money is too heavy, too bulky, and in substantial amounts is dangerous to transport. It is much more convenient and safe to use paper currency. The Founders realized this, but expected the banks to issue notes (redeemable in gold or silver) which would fill this need.</p>
<p>Over the objections of Jefferson and Madison, Alexander Hamilton persuaded Congress to approve a United States Bank for a period of twenty years. This was actually a private bank, but it functioned as a depository for the United States and collected taxes. It also issued redeemable bank notes which circulated as currency. Other private banks did the same. By 1798, Alexander Hamilton decided that this procedure was a mistake. He felt that if currency or bank notes were to be issued and circulated as &#8220;money,&#8221; it should have been done by Congress.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no steps were taken to remedy this problem, so by the time of the Civil War there were thousands of banks issuing thousands of different kinds of bank notes. Furthermore, many banks were issuing far more notes than they had reserves. There was also a tremendous amount of counterfeiting. Before long the whole system began to falter.</p>
<p>When the Civil War required vast new expenditures, the banks wanted extremely high rates of interest on any loans to the Union (15 to 36 percent), and so Congress felt compelled to issue <em>fiat</em> money. These &#8220;greenbacks&#8221; could not be redeemed in gold or silver and were limited somewhat in the things for which they could be spent. Their value soon dropped to around 35 cents.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1878, Congress promised to redeem the greenbacks in gold. This changed the greenbacks from cheap <em>fiat</em> money to debt money, redeemable at face value. At first there was a run on gold as people traded in their greenbacks, but when they found they really could get the gold, then people didn&#8217;t want it. They returned the gold to the bank and took back paper money instead. This left the United States on the gold standard until 1933.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Congress phased out the bank notes issued by state banks by putting a tax on them, thereby discouraging their use. In 1863-64, Congress passed a series of national bank acts which set up a system of privately owned banks chartered by the federal government. These national banks issued notes backed by the U.S. government bonds, and these national bank notes became the country&#8217;s chief currency. When the greenbacks received gold backing in 1878, they also moved up to a par value with the national bank notes.</p>
<p>In 1913 the Federal Reserve replaced the national bank system, and Federal Reserve notes were issued with a promise to redeem them in gold on demand.</p>
<p>Then, in the year 1933, the United States abandoned the gold standard. These were the circumstances:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On April 5, 1933, one month after his inauguration, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a national emergency and ordered all gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates to be turned in to the Federal Reserve banks by May 1. This order applied only to those residing in the United States. It did not apply to foreigners living abroad. Within the United States, only those who had special gold collections or needed the gold for industrial or professional use were allowed to retain quantities of the yellow metal.</li>
<li>As gold coins, gold bullion, or gold certificates were turned in, the American people received Federal Reserve notes redeemable in silver.</li>
<li>On May 22, 1933, Congress enacted a law (48 Stat. 31) declaring all coin and currencies then in circulation to be legal tender, dollar for dollar, as if they were gold. It also empowered the President to reduce the gold content of the dollar up to 50 percent.</li>
<li>On June 5, 1933, Congress enacted a joint resolution (48 Stat. 112) that all gold clauses in contracts were outlawed and no one could legally demand gold in payment for any obligation due him.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 30, 1934, the Gold Reserve Act was passed, giving the Federal Reserve title to all the gold which had been collected. This act also changed the price of gold from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce, which meant that all of the silver certificates the people had recently received for their gold now lost 40 percent of their value.</p>
<p>The next day the President proclaimed (48 Stat. 1730) that the dollar was to be fixed at 15 and 5/21 grains of standard gold and was to be maintained at this level &#8220;in perpetuity.&#8221; This is still the definition of the &#8220;dollar&#8221; in the United States code. Russia and the central banks of Europe began buying up gold in huge quantities. Thus there came into being a dual monetary system: a gold standard for foreigners and Federal Reserve notes (redeemable in silver) for Americans.</p>
<p>From 1914 to 1973, American currency went through the following erosion:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From 1914 to 1933, every Federal Reserve note was redeemable in gold and silver.</li>
<li>Between 1933 and 1963, all Federal Reserve notes promised to pay (or be redeemed) in &#8220;lawful money,&#8221; which meant silver. Then the wording on the Federal Reserve notes began to be changed to somewhat obscure language, which should have given Americans a warning that the government was planning something.</li>
<li>In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson authorized the treasury to begin issuing debased &#8220;sandwich&#8221; dimes and quarters with little or no intrinsic value, and the quantity of silver in fifty-cent pieces was reduced to 40 percent.</li>
<li>On June 24, 1968, President Johnson issued a proclamation that henceforth Federal Reserve silver certificates were merely <em>fiat</em> legal tender and could not be redeemed in silver.</li>
<li>On December 31, 1970, President Richard Nixon authorized the treasury to issue debased &#8220;sandwich&#8221; dollars and half dollars.</li>
<li>By August 1971, many of the European countries had collected so many billions in Eurodollars (foreign aid, money spent by the U.S. military abroad, etc.) that European banks had begun to get nervous about redeeming their money in gold. A threatened run on the U.S. Treasury resulted in the American gold window being slammed shut. This resulted in collapse of the dollar on the world market. Since then it has fluctuated on the world market like any other commodity, since it is no longer redeemable in precious metal and therefore has no intrinsic value.</li>
<li>In 1973, the U.S. dollar was officially devalued, changing the price of gold from $35 per ounce to $42.23 per ounce.</li>
<li>On March 16, 1973, Congress set the American dollar completely afloat with nothing to back it up but the declaration of the government that it was &#8220;legal tender,&#8221; or <em>fiat</em> currency.</li>
<li>The world market immediately reflected serious erosion in the value of the American dollar. To buy an ounce of the gold it took not $42.23 but $100, then $200. After that, it moved higher and higher until it required $800 to buy an ounce of gold. Gradually some confidence was restored in the dollar as the symbol of the American economy, and so it settled back down to a plateau of approximately $300 plus.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the American economy operates under a monetary system which is completely outside the Constitution. Its <em>fiat</em> money is continually manipulated both in value and quantity. This has had a devastating impact on its purchasing power, which is now down to about 8 percent of its 1933 value. It has eroded the value of savings, insurance policies, retirement funds, and the fixed incomes of the elderly.</p>
