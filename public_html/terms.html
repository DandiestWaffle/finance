      11.2     Force Majeure. In the event of adverse conditions in the market place or other factors beyond the control of BullionDirect®, including, but not limited to, acts of God, national emergencies, adverse governmental actions, or suspension of trading of silver, gold, platinum or palladium futures contracts by U.S. commodity exchanges, or the delivery of the Precious Metals underlying such contracts, or the failure or delay of suppliers, the maximum time for delivery of such Products may be extended indefinitely during the period of such adverse circumstances. BullionDirect® will not be responsible for delays or failures in the transmission, receipt or execution of orders, payments, deliveries or information due to the incapacity or failure of computer, transmission or communication facilities which are beyond the control of BullionDirect®. 

      11.3     Possible Equipment Failure.  Transactions executed through the BullionDirect® system are at risk from the potential interruption or failure of the BullionDirect® computer system.

Under such circumstances, it will be necessary for orders to be re-entered, and each one will be given priority according to the price and time at which it is re-entered into the system. Because of this, Customer may designate when an order is placed whether it is to be purged from the system failure.

      11.6     Other Warranties.  ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, GOOD TITLE, OR SATISFACTORY QUALITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IMPOSED BY CONTRACT, STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, CUSTOM OR USAGE OR OTHERWISE ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.
