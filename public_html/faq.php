<b>What is an 'orderbook'?</b>
<br>
An electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument, organized 
by price level. The order book lists the number of shares being bid or offered at each price point, 
or market depth. It also identifies the market participants behind the buy and sell orders. The order 
book is dynamic and constantly updated in real time throughout the day.
