Deposit
We have three methods available for depositing funds: Bank Wire, Automated Clearing House, and Bank Check. Due to the non-immediate nature of debit and credit account transfers – as well as the commissions attached to debit and credit of transactions - we only offer trades to accounts funded by the methods listed on the deposit page.
The deposit page gives you full details on how to add funds to your account, and our customer service team is available to help if you have any questions.

Bank Wire
This is the fastest method for funding your trading account.

ACH Transfer
Allow 2 to 3 business days for an ACH to post to your account.

Bank Check
The slowest method of funding, but also the least expensive!






Fund your Account
Before you begin buying and selling gold and silver on the bullion exchange you’ll also need to fund your account. Please be sure to read and understand the specifics of each account funding option before making the choice that works best for you. Certain methods of funding your account require longer processing times.

There are three account funding options available:

Federal Bank Wire
This is the fastest method for funding your account. Wire transfers generally execute the same day, but may take up to one additional business day to post to your account. Your bank may charge a wire fee.

ACH Transfer
ACH (Automated Clearing House) transfers generally take two to three business days to post to your account. However, the fees to send this type of transfer are normally more affordable than wire fees.

Bank Check
This is the slowest method of funding your account, but also the least expensive. A bank check takes up to 14 business days to post to your account after it is received and processed by Elemetal Vault.
